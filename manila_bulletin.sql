accounting-most-sought-after-job-in-philippines-at-end-june-2025	Accounting most sought-after job in Philippines at end-June 2025	Accounting is the most in-demand job specialization in the country in the first half of the year due to supply shortage despite high demand for STEM fields, according to a study by Jobstreet by SEEK.\nIn a statement, Joey Yusingco, Jobstreet by SEEK head of marketing,said accounting roles comprise 11.81 percent of total job postings from January to June, followed by Information & Communication Technology (ICT) at 11.14 percent and Sales at 10.10 percent, which have consistently remained high in demand. \nThe report noted that Call Centre & Customer Service, Manufacturing, Transport & Logistics, Administration & Office Support, Retail & Consumer Products, Marketing & Communications, Human Resources & Recruitment, and Engineering complete the top 10.\nMoreover, Sales and Marketing & Communications have shown significant increases in job vacancies over the past three months.\nAccording to Jobstreet by SEEK, this rise in demand is linked to the Philippine Statistics Authority's (PSA) projection of an increasing gross domestic product (GDP), from 5.4 percent in the first quarter to a projected 6.2 percent in the second quarter, reflecting the country’s economic growth. \nJobstreet by SEEK noted that this surge in job openings is timely for the thousands of fresh graduates entering the job market, with entry-level positions available on their platform.\nThe online job portal is now averaging 130,000 job posts monthly, facilitated by its AI-powered platform. This increase in listings is attributed to the Free Lite Ads feature, which allows employers to post unlimited job openings for 30 days at no cost, thereby providing jobseekers with access to a broader range of opportunities across various industries.

bringing-compassionate-innovations-to-the-philippine-financial-ecosystem	Bringing compassionate innovations to the Philippine financial ecosystem	In a world where bankers and tycoons dominate the finance industry, Securities and Exchange Commissioner Attorney Rogelio Quevedo stands as a lovable and excited lolo with his heart set on changing the way we view bureaucracy, red tape, and financial assets. At a press conference held recently in Quezon City, Commissioner Quevedo, a long-time teacher at the University of the Philippines College of Law and mentor to some of our country's top senators, shared his thoughts on cybersecurity, digitization, artificial intelligence, and how the SEC can help micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises thrive in their respective industries.\nWith years of experience in working for the country's top telecommunication service providers, Quevedo had his first encounter with managing cybersecurity through the issue of cellphone cloning in the 90s. Cybersecurity breaches are always a major concern for both individuals and corporations, as such issues bring about stoppage of services and possible identity theft. These result to unwanted downtime in businesses, leading to loss of not just profit, but also of public trust. As commissioner of the SEC, Commissioner Quevedo hopes to fortify cybersecurity measures through total digitization of the SEC and with the masterful use of artificial intelligence.\nIt is Commissioner Quevedo's aim for the SEC to gain the Filipino's trust in the government, by creating a conducive financial climate for businesses and clients to both prosper. To further the thrusts of the Ease of Doing Business Act, Commissioner Quevedo plans to reduce the exhausting requirements needed for incorporation and other securities-related matters. Using artificial intelligence to assemble secure databases and automate repetitive tasks, the SEC hopes to ease the need for the submission of redundant documents to every government agency involved in setting up a business. With digitization, the SEC also hopes to user-friendly, accessible, and corruption-free.\nAs a regulator of corporations, including financing and lending companies, Commissioner Quevedo aims for the SEC to create a space for growth and innovation for Filipinos here and abroad. Having worked in the private sector for decades, Commissioner Quevedo knows the Filipino entrepeneur's challenges. He states the importance of being a hands-on leader, stating that a regulator should have his foot on the ground. With this belief, he plans to bring innovations to the SEC based on client feedback. "You have to make sure that your innovation is what your client needs", he reiterates.\nArtificial intelligence, or AI, has become a concern for most in the recent years. With AI technology improving at a rapid rate, AI's capabilities have far exceeded our expectations. From providing fun enhancement to user photos, to text generators, and to the frightening possibilities of deep fakes, AI has become a multi-faceted tool for those who have access to even the simplest computers. But Commissioner Quevedo insists that AI only runs because of human input and that we, as humans, need to learn how to use AI and harness its powers for progress. "AI will never rule our future, but the future will belong to those who embrace AI as a tool to achieve success.", he states.\nThe next 6 years will surely be an exciting time for the SEC with Commissioner Rogelio Quevedo at the helm. Like the Catholic church forging on with a new pope, the SEC Phillipines will now be entering a new phase in their history. "With innovation rooted on practicality, it will always have to be service with compassion", Commisioner Quevedo reminds his agency. In addition to this, the SEC aims to do its part in promoting financial literacy in the Philippines, with every demographic targeted including high schoolers.\nWith Commisioner Quevedo's vision, the Securities and Exchange Commission Philippines will be transformed into a high-tech government agency running with all the powers of digitization, but still with a living, beating heart for the success of every Filipino.

He plans to reduce requirements for incorporation and automate tasks, fostering growth for MSMEs.  Quevedo emphasizes client-centric innovation and promoting financial literacy across all demographics.  The SEC's future will be defined by compassionate service and technological advancement.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/03/bringing-compassionate-innovations-to-the-philippine-financial-ecosystem
america-doesnt-avoid-problems-it-just-solves-them	America doesn't avoid problems. It just solves them	From what we've seen, the second Trump administration wouldn't exactly tiptoe around US interest rate timing. Just recently, US President Donald Trump called US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell a “fool” for acting “too late” in lowering the central bank’s benchmark rate; this is just the latest in a string of criticisms where President Trump has taken Chairman Powell to task for keeping interest rates steady this year. The last time the Federal Reserve made a rate cut was in December 2024, when the US Federal Reserve lowered the rate from 4.50 percent to 4.25 percent.\nFed Chairman Powell, never one to back down, swiftly responded to the criticism, saying that the US Fed’s decision to hold off on any interest rate decrease is the right call right now since the economic data paints a picture of a U.S. in pretty good shape. He made it clear that the US Fed wouldn't budge until the impact of President Trump’s recent tariff policies, particularly on inflation, becomes clear. By the way, Trump’s hike in import tariffs was seen by many as an unprecedented flexing of presidential muscle.\nTrump and his inner circle, it seems, have a somewhat unconventional view of world trade, especially when it comes to trade deficits—that gap between what the USA sells and what it buys from other countries. Plenty of economists have pointed out that trade deficits don’t necessarily put the brakes on economic growth. They argue that trade deficits aren’t a sign of national weakness, highlighting, in particular, the US economy which has ballooned to four times its size during this half-century of trade deficits. Still, Trump sticks to his gut feeling that the United States is getting economically mugged by Europe, China, Mexico, Japan, and Canada. He’s convinced he knows where interest rates should be headed and he’s itching to make a big bet on it and come out on top.\nInterestingly enough, Trump has again threatened to escalate his trade war, floating the idea of a hefty 50 percent tariff on European Union goods starting June 1. He also put Apple on notice, warning he might slap a 25 percent levy on all its imported iPhones. When Trump dropped this latest bombshell, sure enough, US stock indexes and European shares took a hit, the dollar weakened, and yields on US Treasury notes also dipped, all thanks to the anticipated impact of these new tariffs on US economic growth.\nNow, monetary policy is basically a toolkit that a country’s central bank uses to manage the overall money supply, encourage economic growth, and implement strategies like tweaking interest rates and adjusting bank reserve requirements. Obviously, it’s not a roll of the dice, so every potential risk needs to be clearly spelled out. Fiscal policy, on the other hand, is another tool, but it’s strictly for governments, not central banks. In the United States, it’s the Federal Reserve Bank that’s in charge of monetary policy, aiming to achieve that dual goal of maximum employment while keeping inflation in check.\nWhen it comes to The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee, which gets together eight times a year to hash out changes to the country’s monetary policies, the aim is to adjust the level of reserve balances, review or tweak short-term interest rates, and chew over related issues that affect both short and long-term interest rates. The Fed, without seeming to worry too much about pushback from elected officials, gets to pick and choose from various interest rates and different timeframes, which it can then measure and justify. The newly-approved rate then becomes the new discount rate that banks will use to lend, more or less, freely. Expansionary monetary policy is geared towards lowering interest rates, which can get business activities humming and, at the same time, boost the job market.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve (often just called the Fed) wields a lot of global power because it’s the central bank of the United States, solely responsible for running its monetary policy and keeping its financial house in order, which, let’s face it, directly impacts both the U.S. economy and global financial markets. The Fed manages the total amount of U.S. dollars floating around, including dollar substitutes, giving it a platform to influence the amount of money in circulation. Given that the U.S. dollar is the world’s go-to reserve currency, any move the Fed makes on the dollar sends ripples across global economies and international capital markets.\nAs Warren Buffett, widely seen by TIME magazine as one of the sharpest investors around and a beacon of honesty and wisdom in finance, often put it, “America doesn’t avoid problems. It just solves them.”\nAtty. Abelardo “Billy” Cortez brings over 30 years of experience to the table from international and local banking groups (covering treasury, trust, investment management, private banking). He’s a former national FINEX president and past chairman of the Philippine Capital Market Development Council.

acen-copenhagen-firm-partner-for-1-gw-offshore-wind-project-in-camarines-sur	ACEN, Copenhagen firm partner for 1-GW offshore wind project in Camarines Sur	Ayala-led ACEN Corp. has teamed up with Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) for a proposed offshore wind (OSW) project off the coast of Camarines Sur that aims to deliver up to one gigawatt (GW) of capacity.\nIn a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange this Thursday, May 29, ACEN said it has acquired a 25 percent minority stake in CIP’s Growth Markets Fund II, recognized as one of the world’s leading renewable energy (RE) asset managers.\nAccording to ACEN, the Camarines Sur offshore wind initiative stands out as one of the most advanced OSW projects. Its location near San Miguel Bay is characterized by abundant wind resources, shallow water depths, and close proximity to an existing substation.\n"Its in-bay location also presents a lower typhoon risk, further ensuring stability in operations," the company noted.\nThe OSW project is currently in its pre-development phase, awaiting the fifth round of the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Green Energy Auction (GEA-5). The DOE previously indicated that this program would be announced around the third quarter of 2025, aiming to provide a secure and accessible market for industry players. To date, the government has awarded 92 OSW service contracts with a total capacity of approximately 68,656 megawatts (MW), or roughly 69 GW.\nThe Camarines Sur project secured a Wind Energy Service Contract (WESC) in 2023 and was granted Green Lane status by the Board of Investments (BOI) in February 2024, which is expected to expedite necessary licensing and permit processes.\nOther key milestones include the pre-development Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) and a Certificate of Energy Project of National Significance (CEPNS), both obtained in October 2024. In February, the project also secured a Connection Agreement with the National Grid Corp. of the Philippines (NGCP) for its grid integration.\nEric Francia, president and chief executive officer of ACEN, expressed his belief that the partnership with CIP would pave the way for future large-scale clean energy projects in the Philippines.\n"Offshore wind is poised to play a vital role in diversifying the country’s energy mix. ACEN is pleased to partner with CIP, a global leader in the offshore wind sector," he stated.\nRobert Helms, partner at CIP’s Growth Markets Fund II, added that this collaboration would contribute to the government’s current green energy objectives.\n“Together with CIP’s offshore wind expertise, we believe that ACEN’s experience and domestic and international track record in project execution and stakeholder management will set a strong foundation for successful development of the Camarines Sur offshore wind project, including anticipated participation in the upcoming first offshore wind auction,” Helms said. “We are also working towards the ambition of making this one of the first operational offshore wind projects in the Philippines in line with the offshore wind targets set by the current Philippine administration.”\nWhile offshore wind developments are still in the early stages, Juan Paolo Colet, analyst and managing director of Chinabank Capital Corp. considered ACEN’s move with CIP a “powerhouse partnership for OSW”.\n“CIP is a global leader in the field while ACEN is a homegrown renewable energy champion. Their combined global and local expertise and resources will be very important in executing one of the most complex renewable energy projects in the country,” he said.\n“Moreover, having them as project sponsors will certainly help attract a strong syndicate of banks to finance such a landmark undertaking,” Colet added.

acens-sanmar-solar-unlocks-opportunities-for-indigenous-communities-in-zambales	ACEN's SanMar Solar unlocks opportunities for indigenous communities in Zambales	The 585 MW SanMar Solar project, the largest solar farm in the Philippines to date, was built on a barren, lahar-covered expanse of unutilized land in San Marcelino, Zambales.\nACEN, the listed energy platform of the Ayala Group, continues to demonstrate its commitment to inclusive and sustainable growth through its 585 MW SanMar Solar project, the largest solar farm in the Philippines to date.\nWhat was once a barren, lahar-covered expanse of unutilized land—isolated and inaccessible—is now a powerful symbol of transformation. SanMar Solar not only delivers clean energy to the Luzon grid but also bridges long-standing gaps in infrastructure, opportunity, and social equity for its host communities, particularly indigenous peoples (IPs) in the area.\nPowering communities beyond energy\nBuilt across more than 500 hectares of land affected by the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption, SanMar Solar has created over 3,600 green jobs—prioritizing locals from Barangays Santa Fe, San Rafael, and Aglao—and has provided indigenous peoples with opportunities to actively participate in the country’s energy transition.\nThrough a partnership with the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP), ACEN signed a memorandum of agreement in 2023 to provide up to ₱50 million in support of community-led development initiatives across San Marcelino and Papaya Gala. These investments cover livelihood assistance, educational support, organizational development, pandemic and calamity response, and water supply system improvement, as identified by the IP communities.\nAn additional ₱2 million has been allocated to support the formation and official recognition of the San Marcelino Indigenous Political Structure/Organization (IPS/IPO), which includes tools for geotagging and demographic data gathering to strengthen governance and planning.\nACEN also reinforced its support for the community during times of calamities. In the wake of Typhoon Carina in 2024, which devasted several areas in Luzon, including SanMar Solar’s host community, Brgy. Santa Fe, torrential rains rendered the area nearly impassable, cutting off the community and leaving residents in urgent need of assistance.\nBut the company, through its external affairs and development team, swiftly launched a relief operation—braving zero visibility, flood risks and treacherous roads to deliver aid. The team provided 180 liters of fuel, 500 food packs and essential supplies, embodying the bayanihan spirit and bringing much-needed relief in the face of adversity.\nACEN built access roads and bridges for the communities, reducing travel time from up to five hours to just one for IP residents traveling to San Marcelino town.\nBridging access, improving lives\nMore than a solar facility, SanMar Solar has unlocked greater accessibility for remote communities. Nearly six kilometers of roads and two concrete bridges were constructed, reducing travel time from up to five hours to just one for IP residents traveling to San Marcelino town. A 14-kilometer transmission line and new substation now connect this previously underserved area to the power grid.\nACEN is also investing an additional ₱13.9 million to build new community roads, linking project infrastructure with distant sitios where many indigenous families reside.\nGrounded in respect and cultural partnership\nIn December 2023, ACEN joined the IP community and local government representatives in a traditional Padugo ritual at SanMar Solar. This cultural ceremony marked the IP community’s blessing of the project and reaffirmed their role as active partners in its development. The occasion also marked the first time the ritual had been conducted in several years, highlighting the importance of meaningful engagement.\nA solar future rooted in shared progress\nSanMar Solar is being developed in three phases. Phases 1 and 2 are now operational, with Phase 3 expected to be completed by Q4 2026. Once fully completed, the project will power over 187,700 homes and avoid approximately 513,400 metric tons of carbon emissions annually—while continuing to serve as a model for inclusive, community-centered energy development.

bsp-rate-cuts-may-mildly-weaken-peso-focuseconomics	BSP rate cuts may mildly weaken peso—FocusEconomics	The further interest rate cuts anticipated from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) may slightly weaken the peso to beyond the mid-₱56 level this year, according to consensus forecasts collected by the Barcelona-based FocusEconomics.\nIn its June 2025 consensus forecast report for the Philippines, a copy of which was obtained by Manila Bulletin last week, FocusEconomics said the peso is expected to close the year at ₱56.73:$1.\n"The peso should depreciate from current levels by the end of this year as monetary policy easing continues," FocusEconomics said. The peso is currently trading at the ₱55:$1 level.\n"That said, a strong domestic economy will lead to a year-on-year appreciation of the Philippine peso," it added, as the peso settled at the ₱57:$1 level last year.\nFor FocusEconomics, "surging safe-haven demand and higher-for-longer United States (US) rates are depreciatory risks" for the peso, such that the local currency is seen ending 2026 at ₱56.69:$1, only a slight appreciation from its 2025 forecast.\nAcross the economists polled by FocusEconomics, forecasts for the BSP's further monetary policy easing varied from an additional 25 basis points (bps) to as much as 100 bps of cuts in key interest rates before the year ends.\nThese forthcoming rate reductions, coupled with expectations of headline inflation averaging a manageable 2.5 percent this year, would allow the Philippine economy to "remain among ASEAN's [the Association of Southeast Asian Nations] top performers in 2025, broadly maintaining its 2024 pace," FocusEconomics said.\nIts consensus gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast for 2025 has been lowered to 5.7 percent, down by 0.1 percentage point (ppt) from the previous projection and below the government's more ambitious six- to eight-percent target.\nGDP grew by a below-expectations 5.7 percent last year, and by an also dismal 5.4 percent in the first quarter of 2025.\n"Election-related spending should buoy domestic demand, and the economy's relatively smaller exposure to the global tariff war will protect exports. Weaker-than-expected external demand is a downside risk," FocusEconomics said.\nIt said the spending boost from the recently concluded midterm polls would also support second-quarter GDP expansion despite the political risks emanating from the election results.\n"Turning to the second quarter, our panelists have penciled in a further improvement in annual GDP growth on the back of lower interest rates, muted inflation and export frontloading ahead of US tariff hikes," it said.\n"In politics, the Philippines held midterm elections on May 12 that saw President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. lose support in the Senate to Vice President Sara Duterte, which could jeopardize Marcos' fiscal reforms," it added, even as it expects the current administration to continue prioritizing anti-inflationary measures as well as the rollout of big-ticket infrastructure projects to sustain economic growth.\nFor the rest of the year, FocusEconomics said Philippine growth "is set to accelerate from the first quarter's level, with private spending likely to remain a bright spot," adding that "public stimulus measures, low inflation and ongoing interest rate cuts should encourage household consumption, outweighing downside pressures from a weakening external panorama."	"\\tImages/bsp-rate-cuts-may-mildly-weaken-pesofocuseconomics_1.png"	FocusEconomics forecasts a slight weakening of the Philippine peso to ₱56.73:$1 by year-end due to anticipated BSP interest rate cuts.  A strong domestic economy is expected to lead to year-on-year appreciation.  Surging safe-haven demand and higher US rates pose depreciatory risks.

cic-aims-to-de-seasonalize-business-targets-b2b-other-appliances-for-growth	CIC aims to de-seasonalize business, targets B2B, other appliances for growth	While it leads the air-conditioning and refrigerator market, Concepcion Industrial Corporation is seeking to increase its revenue share and market share of its business-to-business (B2B) and other residential appliances units.\nIn an interview, CIC Chairman Raul Joseph A. Concepcion said increasing focus on the B2B and non-refrigerant businesses will allow them to reduce dependence on the household aircon and refrigerators/freezers business, which is cyclical and weather-dependent.\nAccording to CIC Chief Executive Officer Isias Ariel P. Fermin, “We want to de-seasonalize the business because there’s a lot of dependency (on the weather) and it doesn’t have to be that way. So what we have done is to rebuild the B2B part of the business…\n“What we see to be propelling our (B2B) businesses would be the move towards hospitality, tourism, wellness... we see that and we ride that wave as well," he added.\nHe also noted the ongoing renovations of malls and stores, which are now being ramped up by the property and business sectors after being held back during the pandemic.\nAs a building solutions provider, CIC not only designs and installs large-scale air-conditioning systems but also provides other necessities such as elevators and escalators which is has been installing in malls, integrated casino resorts, and airports.\nConcepcion also cited the growth in the food franchising business as a non-cyclical market for their products, as each branch put up will need chest freezers and cooking devices, which CIC also manufactures.\n“The beauty is being a much more diversified company, we’re no longer so much dependent on the weather. We have basically expanded and looked at our total markets, and we participate in a growing market,” he added.\nFermin said that, “If you have to build a restaurant, you will have to build that through summer and through rain because the goal is to increase the operating base. If you have to build a hotel, same thing. So, the more we build into B2B, the better for us.”\nHowever, air-conditioners and refrigerators still account for a large part of the firm’s business and Fermin said revenues this year may not be as strong as in 2024 which was much warmer due to the El Niño phenomenon which boosted sales.\nFermin said that sales started to kick in in April this year but, in 2024, it was already rising in March because of the heat, noting that, “What we’re seeing is that it is not as strong as last year, which is a fair expectation, but still stronger than 2023.”\nBut, even with the cooler temperatures this year, he said they will continue to outperform the market and post higher sales growth compared to the industry average.

boracay-water-leads-visayas-in-ercs-retail-aggregation-program-with-primeres	Boracay Water leads Visayas in ERC's retail aggregation program with PrimeRES	Razon-led water unit on Boracay Island has transitioned into the Retail Aggregation Program (RAP), making it the first to do so with Retail Electricity Supplier (RES) PrimeRES Energy Corp. \nBoracay Water, under the Manila Water Non-East Zone (NEZ) unit, has undergone RAP, a program of the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) which allows small power consumers, such as the island, to select their energy sources.\nUnder the RAP initiative, consumers may select various sources such as including renewable energy (RE), fossil-based, or hybrid; Boracay Water’s aggregation would also allow them to negotiate supply terms, tariffs, and contract durations. \nAccording to Razon-led MORE Power, Boracay Water has aggregated 11 facilities, including its water treatment plants, pumping stations, wastewater treatment facilities, and lift stations—all of which have a total peak demand of 749 kilowatts (kW).\nBased on the RAP program, customers with a minimum of 500 kW demand may be considered for a contestable market.\nMelvin John Tan, Manila Water Philippine Ventures chief operating officer, shared that this marks a significant milestone for the company, as it follows the lead of Manila Water Co., Laguna Water, and Laguna Aquatech when they switched into retail aggregation earlier this year.\n“Boracay Water, together with Akelco and PrimeRES, becomes the first and only RAP-switched entity in the Visayas. We celebrate this not only as a pioneering achievement but as an opportunity to educate and inspire others. Our message is simple—if we can do it, others can too,” he said.\nERC Chairperson Monalisa Dimalanta added that this is a landmark for the commission’s energy initiatives.\n“After just a few months of RAP being piloted in various sectors, we’re thrilled to see it reach the Visayas through Boracay Water’s initiative. This is a landmark moment for energy democracy in the Philippines,” she said.\n“As Boracay Water begins to realize cost savings, we hope more institutions across the country will be inspired to follow suit,” Dimalanta added.\nAside from the ERC, the ceremonial switching was joined by the President of the Independent Electricity Market Operator of the Philippines (IEMOP), chief executive officer of PrimRES Roel Z. Castro, as well as the general manager of Boracay Water, Bryan Magallanes, and representatives of Aklan Electric Cooperative (Akelco) and the Malay Local Government Unit.

bitget-launches-starlink-program-to-bridge-philippine-digital-divide-in-island-communities	Bitget launches Starlink program to bridge Philippine digital divide in island communities	Bitget, the leading cryptocurrency exchange and Web3 company, has launched its Starlink Program, bringing high-speed satellite internet to remote islands in the Philippines in a bold move to tackle digital inequality. The initiative, which kicked off in Siargao’s Espoir School of Life and Barangay Pitogo, addresses chronic connectivity gaps that have long hindered education, healthcare, and economic opportunities. By deploying Starlink’s cutting-edge technology, Bitget aims to empower these communities with reliable internet access, laying the groundwork for future blockchain education and financial inclusion.\nFor years, Siargao’s residents have relied on fragile microwave radio connections, leaving them vulnerable to frequent outages, slow speeds, and exclusion from the digital economy. Schools like Espoir, which serves underprivileged children, struggle with offline-only learning, while villages like Barangay Pitogo face isolation due to unreliable communication networks. "Without stable internet, entire communities are locked out of modern education, remote work, and even basic services like telemedicine. This isn’t just about connectivity, it’s about equity. Internet access shouldn’t be a privilege, it’s the foundation for everything from education to decentralized finance. We’re building doors to the digital world one island at a time," said Vugar Usi Zade, COO at Bitget.\nThe program’s first phase includes a Starlink hardware installations at Espoir School and Barangay Pitogo’s public school. This will provide six months of high-speed satellite internet, enabling access to online curricula, teacher training, and e-governance tools. With this, Bitget plans to provide long-term support through $10M Blockchain 4 Youth and $10M Blockchain 4 Her initiatives, which will introduce blockchain literacy and digital finance skills to students and women-led cooperatives. The total investment of 155,400 Philippine pesos, which covers hardware, subscriptions, and logistics. A modest cost for transformative impact.\nBitget’s initiative shows a growing recognition in the crypto industry: Adoption starts with access. By addressing infrastructure barriers first, the exchange is creating a replicable model for other underserved regions. Future phases could expand to neighboring islands, leveraging partnerships with local NGOs and government units.\nThe Starlink kits will go live in May, with Bitget documenting the rollout through impact reports and community stories. For Espoir’s students, the change will be immediate: interactive lessons, global collaborations, and soon blockchain workshops. For Barangay Pitogo, it’s a leap toward resilient communication during typhoon seasons.\nAs Bitget scales this program, the message is clear: crypto’s future isn’t just about markets, it’s about people. And sometimes, changing lives starts with something as simple as an internet signal.

business-group-flags-severe-ramifications-of-200-daily-wage-hike	Business group flags 'severe ramifications' of ₱200 daily wage hike	The Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCCI) is warning lawmakers about the severe ramifications of the lower chamber-approved ₱200 daily minimum wage hike, calling out its impact on the economy and job security.\nPCCI issued the statement following the House of Representatives’ approval of the bill proposing an across-the-board wage increase in the private sector in its third and final reading on Wednesday, June 4.\nPCCI, the country’s largest business organization, stated that the measure was implemented without considering the consequences it would have on the economy.\nThe group said the wage hike will have wide-ranging effects, including the price of goods and services, those working in the informal sector, and on the micro and small enterprises (MSEs).\n“The wage hike leads to higher labor costs, consequently resulting in higher costs of goods and services, and inflation,” it said.\nPCCI asserted that the benefit of the additional ₱200 wage will only benefit workers in the formal sector, leaving behind the informal sector, which accounts for 50 to 60 percent of the working populace.\n“This will bear down more on workers in the informal sector who are not bound by the minimum wage law,” it added.\nAnother consequence of the measure, if approved, is the inflationary effect, which may further erode purchasing power. This essentially negates the intended benefit of the wage increase.\nThis is feared to reduce jobs in the market as increased operational expense poses the risk of closure of many businesses, particularly MSEs.\nAccording to government data, MSEs account for 96 percent of the total number of enterprises in the country.\nFurthermore, PCCI warned that the proposed wage increase would set a precedent that is poised to undermine the mandate of the Regional Wage Boards (RWBs) perpetually.\nRWBs—comprised of business, labor, and government representatives—were explicitly created to determine region-specific rates based on the local cost of living.\n“Legislating a single wage for all areas can harm businesses in lower-cost regions and remove the flexibility of the RWBs to set wages that are aligned with the situation in the local areas,” said PCCI.\nAfter gaining approval from the lower chamber, the business group hopes that lawmakers will consider the portion of the business section during the bicameral conference committee.\nUnder the committee, lawmakers from both chambers of Congress—the House of Representatives and the Senate—will reconcile the differences of their respective wage hike bills.\nLast year, the upper chamber approved a bill on its third and final reading, proposing a ₱100 across-the-board minimum wage increase for workers in the private sector.\nInstead of the two measures, PCCI said lawmakers should instead adopt a bill that seeks a comprehensive approach in balancing the needs of workers with the capacity of businesses.\nThe group stated that it is crucial for a wage hike to ensure that MSEs continue to thrive while also providing fair wages.\nThe bicameral conference committee is the final step before the measure is transmitted to the president for his approval.\nMalacañang said it will study the economic implications and consult the opinion of the wage boards over the matter.	"\\tImages/business-group-flags-severe-ramifications-of-200-daily-wage-hike_1.png"	The PCCI warns of severe economic ramifications from a proposed ₱200 daily minimum wage hike, citing potential inflation and job losses.  The increase would disproportionately affect the informal sector, comprising 50-60% of the workforce.  This could lead to business closures, especially among MSEs, which account for 96% of enterprises.  PCCI urges a balanced approach considering business capacity and worker needs.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/05/business-group-flags-severe-ramifications-of-200-daily-wage-hike
ayala-corp-offers-6-29-initial-dividend-on-20-billion-preferred-shares	Ayala Corp. offers 6.29% initial dividend on ₱20-billion preferred shares	Zobel-led Ayala Corporation has set the initial dividend rate for the ₱20 billion Class B preferred shares it is re-issuing at 6.2903 percent per annum.\nIn a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange, the conglomerate said it is conducting a Follow-on Public Offering by way of re-issuance from treasury of up to 10 million Class B Preferred Shares at an Offer Price of ₱2,000 per share.\nThe offering consists of a base offer of five million preferred B shares, with an overallotment option of up to five million shares.\nProceeds of the offering will be used to repay its short-term bank loans as well as for general corporate purposes and capital expenditures.\nThe offer shares are expected to be re-issued and listed on the Main Board of the Philippine Stock Exchange on June 18, according to the latest timeline submitted to the SEC. Trading is expected to start on the same date.\nAyala has tapped BPI Capital Corporation, BDO Capital Corporation, Chinabank Capital Corporation, First Metro Investment Corporation, PNB Capital and Investment Corporation, RCBC Capital Corporation, and Security Bank Capital Investment Corporation as joint lead underwriters and bookrunners for the offer.\nThe conglomerate recently reported that its smaller and newer businesses have turned around or are reducing losses amid measures being taken to ensure their profitability in about two years.\n“Our smaller, newer companies are turning the corner. We are constructive on the year,” Ayala President and CEO Cezar P. Consing said.\nFor the first quarter of 2025, AC Health narrowed its net losses to ₱59 million from ₱191 million in the same period last year, driven by improved utilization of facilities and enhanced margins through prudent cost management, supported by the absence of KonsultaMD losses.\nThe improved performance was anchored by stronger results from the provider group, which more than offset softness in the pharma segment.\nAC Logistics’ core net loss narrowed to ₱303 million from ₱400 million on the back of cost savings and margin uplift from the closures of Entrego and the last-mile arm of AIR21.\nSimilarly, attributable EBIT losses narrowed to ₱153 million from ₱229 million as rationalization initiatives reduced OPEX by ₱500 million.\nAC Industrials saw its core net loss narrow to ₱115 million from ₱331 million. Including one-offs, reported net loss narrowed to ₱294 million from ₱932 million.\nIMI’s continued turnaround and reduced stake in Merlin Solar more than offset wider losses in ACMobility.\nACMobility posted a net loss of ₱168 million from ₱35 million due to marketing and manpower expenses, mainly related to the ramp-up of BYD and its charging infrastructure network.\nAyala Corporation Chairman Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala said last month that, “We want to ensure that our emerging business units have a credible path to scale and the ability to achieve good valuation levels. Currently, we're focused on helping our emerging businesses achieve profitability and scale.”	"\\tImages/ayala-corp-sets-interest-rate-for-preferred-shares-to-be-offered-to-the-public_1.png"	Ayala Corp. is re-issuing ₱20 billion in Class B preferred shares with a 6.2903% annual dividend.

acen-powers-up-luzon-grid-with-first-cagayan-solar-plant	ACEN powers up Luzon grid with first Cagayan solar plant	Ayala-led ACEN Corporation is expanding the country’s renewable energy (RE) shift with its 133-megawatt (MW) solar plant in Cagayan.\nIn a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange on Wednesday, June 4, the company announced that this plant is the first in Cagayan to contribute to Luzon’s power grid. It's estimated to generate at least 188 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of RE annually.\nThe Cagayan North Solar Project, situated on a 155-hectare site in Lal-lo, Cagayan, began operations in 2024. According to ACEN, the facility can supply enough power for at least 45,000 households and is projected to cut carbon emissions by 128,000 metric tons.\nEric Francia, ACEN’s Chief Executive Officer and President, highlighted the project’s contribution to the Philippines’ evolving power mix.\n“Cagayan North Solar is the first renewable energy project in Cagayan, supplying clean power to the Luzon grid. As demand for electricity continues to grow, this project plays a vital role in strengthening the country’s energy supply through reliable and sustainable generation,” he stated.\nThe solar facility is a partnership with CleanTech Global Renewables, Inc., which holds a 40 percent stake in the project, while ACEN owns the remaining 60 percent.\nSalvador Antonio Castro, Jr., President and CEO of CleanTech, added that the plant’s operations would also benefit Cagayan’s residents.\n“The Cagayan North Solar power plant is more than just an energy source; it’s a symbol of progress. By delivering clean, renewable electricity to the grid, it strengthens the Philippines' energy resilience while reducing carbon emissions. For host communities, it means new jobs, better infrastructure, and a sustainable future. With every ray of sunlight captured, we illuminate lives and power a nation towards a greener tomorrow,” he remarked.\nDuring its construction phase, the Cagayan North Solar project created 1,000 green jobs, boosting local employment and economic activity in the area.\n“Cagayan North Solar exemplifies Lal-lo’s commitment to sustainable development by prioritizing renewable energy sources. It reduces reliance on non-renewable energy, helping the municipality transition to a cleaner and greener future. The project also fosters inclusive development by channeling benefits directly to host communities,” said outgoing Lal-lo Mayor Florante Pascual.\nCurrently, ACEN has less than 7 GW of attributable RE capacity, which includes operational, under-construction, and committed projects. Beyond its local developments, the Ayala-led firm also has investments in strategic markets such as Australia, Vietnam, India, Laos, Indonesia, and the United States.

airasia-move-no-manual-fare-manipulation-committed-to-consumer-trust	AirAsia MOVE: No manual fare manipulation, committed to consumer trust	AirAsia MOVE (MOVE) vowed to collaborate with the government to establish industry-wide safeguards ensuring customer protection, following a Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) inquiry regarding an alleged overpricing incident involving a domestic flight carrier in Tacloban.\nIn a statement, Nadia Omer, AirAsia MOVE chief executive officer, said their pricing mechanism is automated, with no manual intervention or manipulation of fares on the platform. \nShe also noted that all fares are sourced from third-party aggregators and are not set by an Online Travel Agency (OTA) like MOVE.\nOn Thursday, June 5, Omer appeared before CAB officials to clarify the supply chain process in OTA industry. \n"We thank the CAB for giving us the opportunity to be heard at a proper venue in the observance of due process," Omer said. "The issue at hand has become a platform to proactively engage and educate stakeholders on how the supply chain works within OTAs." \nShe added that OTAs operate through third-party aggregators and direct airline partners, with these aggregators engaging airlines to sell seats. \nOTAs, Omer clarified, function as a marketing arm or platform and therefore lack the ability to manually alter prices passed on from these suppliers or airline partners. \n"We also want to clarify that there is no overpricing and manipulation as these go against the very principle of our company – to provide affordable fares and a wide range of options to make traveling more accessible and inclusive for every consumer, on every budget," Omer added.\nFollowing a cease and desist order, MOVE immediately contacted the third-party suppliers, requesting the immediate removal of the fares in question. \nDuring its internal investigation, MOVE confirmed that no booking transaction was made, and likely no passengers were affected by the displayed fare. \n"Other than facing intense public scrutiny, MOVE did not gain any commission out of the fares in question. We immediately asked our third-party suppliers to provide a written explanation to ensure full clarity on the issue," Omer noted.\nIn the Philippines, airline fares are regulated by the CAB, while the Department of Tourism (DOT) monitors accommodation rates, with complaints about OTA pricing typically referred to the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). \n"As a company that advocates consumer protection, MOVE is ready to work closely with the government in setting up a task force and developing policies to monitor pricing across to ensure alignment not just on booking platforms, but across the third-party supply chain," Omer said. \n"We ask that the government also strike a balance between monitoring and regulating OTAs to ensure equal protection while encouraging economic activity and driving tourism. OTAs, like MOVE, are here to democratize travel by providing a wide range of options that suits every traveler’s budget requirements and travel aspirations," Omer added.

Following a CAB inquiry, MOVE cooperated fully and confirmed no transactions were made at the allegedly inflated fares.

bsp-has-plenty-of-room-to-cut-interest-rates-uob	BSP has 'plenty of room' to cut interest rates—UOB	With falling inflation and elevated positive real interest rates, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) is all set to further slash the key borrowing rate on June 19, according to Singapore-based United Overseas Bank (UOB).\nThe five-and-a-half-year low headline inflation of 1.3 percent recorded in May "reinforc0es our view that the BSP will cut the overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) rate by another 25 basis points (bps) to 5.25 percent" when the policy-making Monetary Board decides on the monetary policy stance two Thursdays from now, UOB economist Loke Siew Ting said in a June 5 report.\n"After that, the easing path will hinge on global tariff and financial market developments as well as incoming inflation and domestic growth data," UOB said.\nThe Singaporean bank said it helps that "higher positive real interest rates, which are at an almost 10-year high, also indicate that the central bank has plenty of room to ease in the near term."\nUOB expects a total of 75 bps more in BSP rate cuts until year-end, to bring the policy rate further down to 4.75 percent.\nIn particular, it sees the BSP reducing key interest rates by 25 bps each in the three remaining quarters of 2025, before pausing in the first quarter of 2026.\nWhile inflation averaged 1.9 percent during the first five months—below the targeted two- to four-percent annual price increases deemed manageable and conductive to economic growth, UOB maintained its full-year forecast at two percent, "given the ongoing non-monetary intervention by the national government as well as expectations of lower global oil prices and a stronger Philippine peso in the remaining months of the year."\n"In the absence of adverse weather events, softer global demand on account of uncertainty surrounding global trade and tariff policies is also expected to further keep inflation modest in the near term," UOB said.

The bank anticipates further cuts totaling 75 bps by year-end, reaching a 4.75 percent policy rate.  Higher positive real interest rates give the BSP room to ease.

consumer-sentiment-falls-in-q1-as-price-job-worries-mount	Consumer sentiment falls in Q1 as price, job worries mount	Filipino consumer confidence has declined in the first three months of the year due to concerns over rising prices, lower incomes, and fewer job opportunities, according to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP).\nBased on the latest Consumer Expectations Survey (CES) of the central bank, the overall consumer confidence index (CI) fell to -13 percent in January to March, a further deceleration from -11.1 percent in the previous quarter and -10.9 percent in the same period last year.\nA negative CI indicates that more consumers are pessimistic than optimistic about the economic outlook. The BSP monitors CES results as a factor in its monetary policy decisions.\nIn response to the survey findings, the BSP reiterated its commitment to its mandates, including maintaining manageable inflation. \nThe central bank noted that, based on its latest estimates, inflation is projected to remain within the 2.0 percent to 4.0 percent target range from this year through 2027. The BSP added that stable inflation supports investments and job creation.\nConsumers also shared their sentiment for the near future, with confidence for the succeeding quarter returning to negative territory. \nThe CI for the next quarter settled at -0.5 percent, a drop from 4.2 percent in the previous quarter and 2.7 percent in the first quarter of last year.\nHowever, consumers expect economic prospects to improve over a longer horizon. For the next 12 months, survey results showed a positive CI of 12.4 percent, which remained unchanged from the previous quarter but was slightly lower than the 13.4 percent recorded in the first quarter of last year.\nIn May, the inflation rate continued to decline for the fourth straight month, dropping to 1.3 percent from 1.4 percent the previous month, due to a reduction in utility costs during this time.\nThe May inflation print aligned with the BSP forecast that inflation would fall within the range of 0.9 percent to 1.7 percent for the month.\nIt also marked the slowest inflation rate since November 2019, when it was recorded at 1.2 percent.	"\\tImages/consumer-sentiment-falls-in-q1-as-price-job-worries-mount_1.png"	Filipino consumer confidence fell to -13 percent in Q1 2025 due to rising prices, lower incomes, and job losses.  The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) monitors this as a factor in monetary policy.  While near-term confidence is negative, consumers expect improvement over the next 12 months. May's inflation rate dropped to 1.3 percent, the slowest since November 2019.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/06/consumer-sentiment-falls-in-q1-as-price-job-worries-mount
bsp-projects-much-cooler-inflation-for-may-2025	BSP projects much cooler inflation for May 2025	Filipino consumers can anticipate a substantial easing of inflation in May this year, according to the latest forecast from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). \nThe central bank projects inflation to settle within the range of 0.9 percent to 1.7 percent in May, a significant deceleration compared to the 3.9 percent inflation rate recorded in the same month last year. \nIt also indicated a potential further cooling of prices from the 1.4 percent inflation observed in April 2025, which was already the lowest since November 2019.\nThe BSP attributed this expected downward trend primarily to easing prices of essential food items like rice and fish, which are benefiting from favorable domestic supply conditions.\nAdditionally, lower oil prices, reduced electricity rates, and the appreciation of the Philippine peso are contributing to the anticipated slower inflation.\nHowever, the central bank cautioned that these downward pressures could be partially offset by higher prices of vegetables and meat products.	"\\tImages/bsp-projects-much-cooler-inflation-for-may-2025_1.png"	The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) forecasts a significant decrease in inflation to 0.9-1.7 percent in May 2025. This is a substantial drop from 3.9 percent in May 2024 and 1.4 percent in April 2025.  Easing food prices, lower oil prices, and a stronger peso contribute to this.  However, higher vegetable and meat prices could partially offset these downward pressures.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/05/30/bsp-projects-much-cooler-inflation-for-may-2025
bpi-makes-10-instapay-transfer-fee-permanent	BPI makes ₱10 InstaPay transfer fee permanent	Nearly three months after launching a promotional ₱10 transaction fee, Ayala-led Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) has decided to keep the lower fee as a permanent feature for interbank fund transfers (IBFT) carried out via InstaPay, due to strong customer demand.\nThe BPI has announced in a statement released on Monday, June 2, that the lower ₱10 Instapay fee will become “a permanent feature for inter-bank fund transfers made through the BPI app and BPI online.” This took effect on Sunday, June 1.\n“In response to strong customer demand and positive feedback, BPI is making this benefit a permanent feature beyond the initial promotional period,” the BPI said.\nMaria Cristina Go, BPI head of consumer banking, noted that the response to the bank’s promotion last March was “very positive.” Go said this was evident in “increased transactions through our online and mobile banking channels.”\nThe BPI said that this decision reflects the bank’s “commitment to making digital financial services more affordable for its customers—offering one of the lowest transfer fees in the industry.”\nGo said the move was also part of the bank’s commitment to deliver “convenient, secure, and cost-efficient digital services” that would help Filipinos manage their finances “more effectively.”\n“With this update, users can continue to enjoy real-time, low-cost InstaPay transfers anytime, anywhere via the BPI app and BPI online,” the bank said.\nThe BPI earlier introduced the lower transaction fee as a promotional rate “to encourage customers to use digital platforms to manage their money.”\nIt particularly covered all bank’s customers who use the BPI app, BPI online, or BizKo. From ₱25 fee, the BPI slashed its InstaPay IBFT fee by ₱15 to ₱10 per transaction.\n“By making the rate permanent, BPI supports greater financial inclusion and helps customers keep more of their money where it matters—especially when making frequent interbank fund transfers,” the BPI said.	"\\tImages/bpi-makes-10-instapay-transfer-fee-permanent_1.png"	BPI's ₱10 InstaPay transfer fee, initially a promotion, is now permanent due to positive customer response and increased online transactions.  This reflects BPI's commitment to affordable digital financial services and helps Filipinos manage finances more effectively.  The lower fee, previously ₱25, is available via the BPI app and BPI online.  This move supports greater financial inclusion.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/02/bpi-makes-10-instapay-transfer-fee-permanent
ayalas-imi-offloads-czech-republic-operations-to-chinas-keboda-in-cost-cutting-move	Ayala's IMI offloads Czech Republic operations to China's Keboda in cost-cutting move	The Ayala Group’s electronics manufacturing arm, Integrated Micro-Electronics Inc. (IMI), is selling its facilities in the Czech Republic to a China-based firm for about ₱636 million as it continues to rationalize its global operations to return to profitability.\nIn a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange, IMI stated that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Coöperatief IMI Europe U.A., has signed a share purchase agreement to sell 100 percent of the shares in IMI Czech Republic (IMI CZ) to KEBODA Deutschland GmbH & Co. KG.\nThe buyer is a subsidiary of Keboda Technology Co., Ltd. (Keboda), a publicly listed company in China. Keboda was founded in 2003 and is headquartered in Shanghai. It is a leading system solution provider for intelligent and energy-efficient electronic components in the automotive industry.\nThe total consideration is €10.03 million, subject to post-closing adjustments, to be paid in three tranches. €1 million upon signing of the share purchase agreement, €8.53 million upon closing of the deal, and €500,000 10 business days after closing, accounts become final.\n“This sale was executed as part of IMI’s restructuring and footprint rationalization program which was initiated in the second half of 2024.\n“The move will further reduce overhead and administrative expenses as the company consolidates its operations in Europe into its Bulgaria and Serbia facilities,” IMI said.\nIMI added that it remains fully committed to its customers in the Czech Republic. A majority of the customers previously served by IMI Czech Republic have already been smoothly transitioned to IMI’s facilities in Serbia and Bulgaria.\nFor the remaining customers, IMI will ensure uninterrupted service until they are relocated to alternative IMI locations or their products reach end-of-life.\nThis ongoing support will be provided under a manufacturing services agreement with Keboda, established as part of the share purchase agreement.\nClosing of the deal will happen as the parties fulfill the conditions precedent of the deal. These include governmental approvals, settlement of financing agreements, completion of business carveouts to other IMI European sites, and the execution of the manufacturing services agreement between IMI and Keboda.\nLast January, IMI announced the strategic closure of its facility in Chengdu, China as part of ongoing efforts to streamline operations and reduce costs, aligning with the company’s strategy to consolidate its footprint into strategically located facilities.\nProduction at IMI Chengdu concluded in December 2024 after all customer commitments have been successfully met although some remaining customer projects have been seamlessly transferred to other IMI sites.

cmepa-law-welcomed-lower-taxes-expected-to-spur-stock-market-growth	CMEPA law welcomed: Lower taxes expected to spur stock market growth	Regulators and stock market players are welcoming the enactment of the Capital Markets Efficiency Promotion Act (CMEPA), as it is key to attracting more investors and boosting trading activity on the local bourse.\n"The passage of CMEPA sends a clear message to both domestic and global investors that the Philippines is committed to building deeper, more efficient capital markets. This reform is expected to boost and strengthen liquidity, trading activity, capital formation, and contribute to broader economic growth,” said Special Assistant to the President for Investment and Economic Affairs Frederick D. Go.\nGo championed the passage of the law with the legislature. Among other provisions, CMEPA provides for a reduced stock transaction tax from 0.6 percent to 0.1 percent, which is seen as encouraging more trading activity at the Philippine Stock Exchange.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also applauded the Marcos administration’s strong resolve to deepen the Philippine capital market with the enactment of CMEPA.\n“We welcome the enactment of the CMEPA, a key piece of legislation that strengthens our ability as regulators to create an environment that not only increases capital market accessibility to more Filipinos, but also builds trust and confidence in long-term investing,” SEC Chairperson Emilio B. Aquino said.\nHe added that, “Together, these significant tax reforms pave the way for a more dynamic capital market that will foster a robust and investor-friendly financial ecosystem.”\n“The new law reducing the stock transaction tax is great news for investors. It makes buying and selling stocks cheaper (at par with other regional markets), which can attract more people to invest,” said Jonathan Ravelas, senior adviser at Reyes Tacandong & Co.\nHe added that, “This could lead to more trading, better market activity, and help grow the Philippine stock market overall.”\n“We expect CMEPA’s implementation to boost the stock market. The significant reduction in the stock transaction tax will help improve investor returns, increase trading frequency and value turnover, and lead to tighter bid-ask spreads,” said Chinabank Capital Corporation Managing Director Juan Paolo Colet.\nHe noted that, “The government is moving in the right direction when it comes to market-friendly reforms, and we hope they sustain this by introducing more initiatives to broaden and deepen our public equities market.\n“We need to create conditions that help us in getting more listed companies and attracting more stock investors.”\nRizal Commercial Banking Corporation Chief Economist Michael L. Ricafort said CMEPA will help reduce transaction costs, especially for large investors or institutional funds, both local and foreign.\nHe also noted that it is a “Pleasant surprise that President Marcos vetoed the proposed removal of the tax exemption on non-resident income from Foreign Currency Deposit Units. This could help maintain, especially large FCDU deposits or funds in the country.”\n“This is a positive signal as one of the priority tax measures to simplify taxation especially on passive income while collecting more recurring sources of tax revenues for the government,” Ricafort added.\nSalient provisions under the CMEPA include the reduction of the stock transaction tax to 0.1 percent from 0.6 percent, as well as the lowering of the documentary stamp tax (DST) on the original issue of shares to 0.75 percent from one percent, which are seen to promote greater market liquidity and investor participation.\nThe removal of the DST on mutual funds and unit investment trust funds (UITFs), along with the tax exemption on income derived from the redemption of such units, will encourage more Filipinos to participate in long-term investment vehicles and deepen our capital markets.\nThe CMEPA further standardizes the final withholding tax on interest income at 20 percent, simplifying compliance across investment instruments. Meanwhile, the harmonization of the capital gains tax to a flat 15 percent on shares of foreign corporations aligns the Philippine tax regime with global standards and helps attract more foreign investments.\nThe new law is also seen to attract more Filipinos to increase their retirement funds through the Personal Equity and Retirement Account Act (PERA), by enabling employers to claim an additional 50 percent tax deduction for PERA contributions, provided they match or exceed the employee’s contribution.\n“Since its enactment, the SEC has been advocating for more Filipinos to take advantage of the PERA to augment their employee-provided retirement funds. With CMEPA, we hope more people will see value in investing in PERA to encourage financial independence in their retirement years,” Aquino said.	"\\tImages/cmepa-law-welcomed-lower-taxes-expected-to-spur-stock-market-growth_1.png,Images/cmepa-law-welcomed-lower-taxes-expected-to-spur-stock-market-growth_2.png"	CMEPA's passage signals the Philippines' commitment to deeper, more efficient capital markets, boosting liquidity and trading activity.  The law reduces stock transaction tax from 0.6% to 0.1%, encouraging more trading at the Philippine Stock Exchange.  Regulators welcome the act, expecting increased investor participation and a more dynamic capital market.  This is expected to improve investor returns and attract more foreign investments.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/03/cmepa-law-welcomed-lower-taxes-expected-to-spur-stock-market-growth
boc-seizes-41-billion-worth-of-fake-goods-in-2024-vows-intensified-crackdown	BOC seizes ₱41-billion worth of fake goods in 2024, vows intensified crackdown	With the Bureau of Customs (BOC) contributing the largest share in the seizure of nearly ₱41-billion worth of counterfeit goods, the agency has vowed to intensify its crackdown on the trade of fake products to protect consumers and legitimate businesses.\nThe BOC, the country’s second-largest revenue collection agency, accounted for 85 percent of total seizures conducted by the National Committee on Intellectual Property Rights (NCIPR) last year.\nIn particular, the agency confiscated counterfeit goods amounting to ₱34.698 billion out of the ₱40.99 billion total recorded by NCIPR—a record-breaking figure, according to the BOC.\nAs a result, the BOC received recognition from the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines (IPOPHL) “for leading the country in intellectual property rights (IPR) enforcement.”\nOne of the agency’s largest operations took place in Binondo, Manila, where it seized over ₱11-billion worth of counterfeit luxury goods in a single raid.\nFor the first four months of 2025, the BOC has already seized ₱15.8-billion worth of counterfeit goods. This effort was carried out in close coordination with global brand representatives and IPR enforcement partners.\n“The BOC has vowed to intensify these efforts,” the agency said.\n“We are not letting up. We will continue to act decisively against counterfeit trade to protect consumers and legitimate businesses,” Customs Commissioner Bienvenido Rubio said.\nRubio emphasized that protecting intellectual property rights is key to creating a “fair, secure, and investor-friendly trade environment.”\nHe added that the recent award was a recognition of the agency’s “firm resolve to crack down on counterfeit goods,” as it recorded the highest number of counterfeit seizures.\nThe recognition was given during the 2025 Gawad Yamang Isip Awards, held at the 191st NCIPR regular meeting.\nThe 15-member NCIPR continues to strengthen laws and inter-agency cooperation to curb the entry and sale of pirated goods in the country.

bsp-plans-permanent-broader-calamity-aid-for-banks	BSP plans permanent, broader calamity aid for banks	The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) has proposed formally adopting and expanding regulatory relief measures for banks affected by disasters, which would include a six-month grace period for loan repayments and the temporary exclusion of these loans from bad loan classifications.\nAccording to a draft Circular issued by the BSP on Monday, June 2, the central bank has proposed to amend the regulatory relief policy for banks “by providing additional regulatory measures that will enhance their capacity to bounce back and continue providing timely financial services to their clients.”\nThis comes with the central bank’s objective of “strengthening banks’ operational resilience through business continuity or disaster recovery measures.”\nIt was at the beginning of the year that the relief measures were introduced for banks impacted by a series of destructive typhoons, such as Tropical Storm “Kristine” and Super Typhoons “Leon,” “Ofel,” and “Pepito.”\nThe central bank is now considering these measures for formal adoption, it said in the draft’s explanatory note.\nNotable provisions include the temporary grace period for loan payments. Banks in disaster-stricken areas may give borrowers up to six months of payment relief, starting from the date the calamity began.\nAs such, soured loans during this period would be temporarily excluded from computations of past-due and non-performing loans (NPLs).\n“Loans extended to affected borrowers may be temporarily excluded from past due and NPL computations for one year from the inception date of the calamity,” the BSP said in the draft.\nBased on the proposed changes, banks can now access regulatory relief measures within one year from the start of a calamity, “which may be earlier than the date of official declaration of a state of calamity.”\nAlso, the deadline for submitting BSP-approved loan requests for officers affected by calamities has been extended from 30 to 90 days.\nSeveral relief measures introduced during the pandemic are also proposed to be part of the regulatory relief policy, including relaxed ID requirements for households and micro-businesses in affected areas for a period of three months.\nBanks can also notify the BSP of changes in banking hours or temporary branch closures through email or SMS, defer branch openings for up to three years, and spread impairment loss recognition over three years with BSP approvals.\nAdditionally, the BSP is proposing standardized loan relief for borrowers in the agriculture sector, allowing for payment postponement and adjusted repayment terms based on crop cycles due to climate-related risks.\nBanks have until June 18 to submit their feedback. If finalized, the policy is expected to take effect 15 days after publication in the Official Gazette or a newspaper of general circulation.

big-business-employers-warn-200-wage-hike-threatens-investment-fuels-inflation	Big business, employers warn ₱200 wage hike threatens investment, fuels inflation	The country’s leading organizations of business executives and employers are voicing their concerns with the proposed ₱200 daily minimum wage increase, citing potential impact on investment, inflation, and small businesses. The House of Representatives approved the bill proposing an across-the-board wage hike for workers in the private sector on Wednesday, June 4, in its third and final reading. The measure now awaits the bicameral conference committee, where members of the House and the Senate reconcile the differences of their respective wage hike bills. In February of last year, the upper chamber approved a counterpart bill proposing a ₱100 wage increase. As the final step before the bill’s transmittal to the president, the Makati Business Club (MBC) and the Employers Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP) are cautioning the government of the consequences of legislating a nationwide wage increase. MBC, which comprises the country’s leading business leaders, pointed out that increasing the minimum wage “may have a tendency to trigger added inflation.” The group said lawmakers should instead focus on crafting measures that will help bring down the high prices of basic goods, especially food. “If we don't address the prices of basic goods, there will be continuing pressure to keep increasing wages, which is not only inflationary, but also makes us less competitive and productive,” it said. MBC warns that ramping up wages, which are already among the highest in Southeast Asia, will make the country “less attractive” for investors, leading to less job creation. “The Makati Business Club is not against wage increases per se, and we do acknowledge the argument for wage increases now. We believe that these should be addressed by the regional wage boards (RWBs), which take into account the cost of living in the particular area,” the group said. “There is no compelling reason for Congress to bypass these wage boards, as it has in this instance,” it added. RWBs—comprised of business, labor, and government representatives—were specifically established to determine and set region-specific rates based on the local cost of living. ECOP President Sergio Ortiz-Luis said this places President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. in a difficult position as the proper way to raise wages has always been through the wage boards. Malacañang earlier stated that it will study the economic implications and consult with the wage boards on the matter. Ortiz-Luis has floated that the bill’s approval in the lower chamber could be politically motivated, “related to promises made during the election.” He said the measure, if enacted, would affect micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), which account for 99 percent of businesses in the Philippines. The wage adjustment, he said, would leave MSMEs with no choice but to raise prices, cut jobs, or close their business altogether. Ortiz-Luis added that the measure would only benefit 10 to 16 percent of the 52 million workers in the country, leaving workers in the informal sector, such as farmers, fisherfolk, and jeepney drivers, without an added wage. “Eighty-four to ninety percent will be suffering because of the yearly benefits we’re giving to the minority,” he said.

The Makati Business Club and Employers Confederation of the Philippines advocate for regional wage boards to determine increases.  They argue that a nationwide increase would harm small businesses and reduce the country's attractiveness to investors.  The bill's passage may be politically motivated, and its impact on the informal sector is a concern.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/06/big-business-employers-warn-200-wage-hike-threatens-investment-fuels-inflation

cebu-pacifics-expansion-plans-face-potential-headwinds-from-us-eu-trade-tensions	Cebu Pacific's expansion plans face potential headwinds from US-EU trade tensions	Low-cost carrier Cebu Pacific is closely monitoring the potential fallout from the reimposition of the United States’ new tariff policy on its record ₱1.4 trillion deal to purchase aircraft from European manufacturing giant Airbus SE.\nIn October last year, the Gokongwei-led airline finalized a landmark purchase agreement with Airbus and engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney for what is considered the largest acquisition in Philippine aviation history.\nCebu Pacific specifically secured the order to acquire up to 152 A321neo (new engine option) aircraft.\nThe airline is set to receive the first batch of jets from Airbus by 2029.\nCebu Pacific President and Chief Commercial Officer Xander Lao said Airbus has yet to issue a notice to the carrier regarding potential issues with the order.\n“It's a developing situation...So let's see what happens. But so far, we've not seen any impact to deliveries or operations,” said Lao.\nLast month, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a new tariff policy targeting the majority of the country's trading partners.\nSpecifically, he imposed a baseline ten percent tariff on all foreign-based goods coming into America. This is alongside the higher reciprocal tariffs imposed by the US on countries with which it has a trade deficit.\nIn a Reuters report, U.S. aviation leaders are raising concerns over potential risks associated with the delay of shipments, even though aircraft deliveries are typically ordered years in advance.\nWhile Airbus is based in Europe, the fallout from Trump’s tariffs is expected to affect the global market, particularly as reciprocal tariffs are set to be reimposed in July.\n“Look, you can't worry about something that you can't predict because it's really different, every day the mood changes. So let's see what the impact of those tariffs will be,” said Lao.\nDespite the looming threat of the tariffs, Lao said the airline is upbeat that its aircraft order will be unaffected by policy and trade shifts.\n“We do have contractual protections in our contracts for those orders. So we're not worried at this time,” he pointed out.\nLao likewise said traffic volume will remain robust even as passengers may cast uncertainty in their spending while awaiting the impact of the tariffs.\nIn the first quarter of the year, Cebu Pacific saw its traffic volume rise 26 percent to seven million from 5.5 million during the same period last year.\nThe airline delivered 17 aircraft in 2024, concluding the year with a fleet of 98 aircraft.\nIt is expecting seven more deliveries this year, breaching the 100-aircraft milestone.\nCebu Pacific currently operates in 37 domestic and 26 international destinations spanning Asia, Australia, and the Middle East.

ayala-land-to-launch-ayala-malls-arca-south-in-december	Ayala Land to launch Ayala Malls Arca South in December	Real estate giant Ayala Land Inc. is set to launch its latest mall, the Ayala Malls Arca South, in December this year as part of plans to raise the appeal of the 74-hectare Arca South in Taguig as Metro Manila’s next major business district.\nIn a statement, the firm said it is ramping up development at Arca South which is envisioned to follow in the footsteps of Makati and Bonifacio Global City.\nAt the heart of this transformation is Ayala Malls Arca South, a key lifestyle and commercial destination that is poised to serve as the estate’s central hub.\nIt will bring together a curated mix of global and local retail brands, destination dining concepts, entertainment options, and civic spaces—all within a walkable, community-centric layout.\n“The first phase is launching at the end of the year, and it will be a reflection of a new way of thinking about what community centers are, most especially destination centers,” said ALI Leasing and Hospitality Group Head Mariana Zobel de Ayala.\nShe added that, “We envision Ayala Malls Arca South as the ultimate destination marketplace — fresh produce, flowers and plants, crafts, pa-luto, and coffee roasteries — all anchored on the best of the Philippines. If we succeed, it will be a place people will go out of their way to travel to.”\nAmong the mall’s key features is a vibrant Food Hall designed as a convergence space for diverse flavors and cultures.\nA dedicated Market Hall will spotlight regional delicacies and fresh produce through a cook-to-order dining concept, while a first-of-its-kind artisanal coffee hub—equipped with modern working pods—will cater to professionals and digital nomads.\nArca South is also seeing robust momentum in residential, healthcare, and infrastructure development.\nSix residential developments from Ayala Land Premier, Alveo and Avida provide a range of housing options that seamlessly blend luxury and convenience. Arbor Lanes and Gardencourt Residences, Ayala Land Premier’s signature projects, continue to attract interest with its integration of nature, open spaces, and luxury living.\nComplementing the residential mix is a growing portfolio of community anchors. These include the Healthway Cancer Care Hospital, the Philippines’ first dedicated cancer hospital; Landers Superstore, a membership-based retail hub; and The Arca South Pitch, home to Barça Academy Manila to support youth sports and recreation.\nNext year, The Blue Leaf will also open its doors within the estate, offering a premium venue for social and corporate events.\nAccessibility is expected to further improve with the completion of the Taguig City Integrated Terminal Exchange (TCITx)—an intermodal facility being developed in partnership with key government agencies and the private sector.\nOnce operational, TCITx will connect Arca South to the Skyway, Southeast Metro Manila Expressway (C6), the Metro Manila Subway and the North-South Commuter Railway, easing traffic congestion, providing alternative transport routes, and significantly reducing travel times across Metro Manila and beyond.\nArca South reflects Ayala Land’s urban development model—integrating residential, commercial, office, and civic uses into a cohesive, people-first environment.\nThe estate’s prime location, robust infrastructure pipeline, and sustainability-led design position it as a long-term value driver for residents, businesses, and investors alike.\nWith several key projects coming online and critical infrastructure nearing completion, Arca South is emerging as a future-ready central business district—designed for growth, anchored in community, and primed to meet the evolving needs of southern Metro Manila.

online-gaming-war-heats-up-as-bloomberry-travellers-brace-for-costly-fight	Online gaming war heats up as Bloomberry, Travellers brace for costly fight	The advertising industry will be the clear winner when more casino operators try to jump on the online gaming bandwagon since these new players will have to spend billions of pesos monthly just to get a foot into the market and take some market share away from the first movers.\nUnicapital Securities Research Analyst Jeri R. Alfonso said Bloomberry Resorts Corp. of billionaire Enrique K. Razon Jr. will be launching its Megafunalo online gaming platform next month.\nAbacus Securities Corp. said tycoon Andrew Tan’s Alliance Global Group Inc. will also be launching an online gaming platform, while Hann Holdings Inc. also revealed in its initial public offering (IPO) prospectus that it is also planning to enter the highly lucrative online gaming market.\nIt noted that, Bloomberry confirmed it will spend heavily, in the order of at least ₱1 billion to ₱2 billion per quarter just on advertising and promotions to help the online business get some traction.\nAlfonso said Bloomberry has already reported higher operating expenses tied to its gaming app launch and “we think Travellers (AGI subsidiary Travellers International Hotel Group Inc.) is likely to follow the same cost trend as it gears up to go online.\n“The bulk of these costs will come from customer acquisition efforts, with both companies aiming to close the gap with market leaders. Development-related expenses, especially for outsourced services, are also set to climb.”\nAbacus said Bloomberry’s management has revealed that they have a third-party provider for the mobile app being developed who will then be entitled to a revenue sharing scheme which wasn't specified.\n“While this mitigates the risk, Bloomberry won't fully enjoy the benefit if/when online does become profitable. In the near to medium term, the losses from this venture will likely be substantial and will probably drag into next year before it starts to contribute positively to the bottom line,” it said.\nMeanwhile, Abacus pointed out that, “Digiplus Interactive Corp.’s spectacular rise and booming profits may have given the impression that it's all easy money and that Bloomberry can just waltz in and join the party.”\n“Truth is, Digiplus has had to spend more and more to acquire active users. Last year, the company spent three times as much as it did on advertising and promotion and it still actually lost a few percentage points of market share in terms of gross gaming revenue (GGR),” the brokerage said.\nDigiplus Vice President for Investor Relations and Corporate Communications Celeste Jovenir said a "majority of our A&P spend is for promotion credits and digital ads.”\nAbacus explained that, “Unlike with physical goods or most other services, there are no price points (in the normal sense of the word) in e-gaming. In this case, therefore, the company may have to offer better odds and bigger prizes to gain traction. There will have to be heavy investment in customer service and technology as well.”\nAlfonso also said that, “In our view, if Bloomberry and Travellers give out compelling payouts or jackpot prizes, they could pull users away from established platforms like Digiplus.”\nHowever, Abacus said, “Current e-gaming operators are already well-established and are probably prepared for new competitors. And, the fact is, business literature is replete with anecdotal evidence that is much more expensive for a new play to try taking market share than it is for incumbents to defend theirs. And not only will it probably take two years (or longer) to turn a meaningful profit, medium-term earnings will take a hit.”	"\\tImages/bloomberry-travellers-will-need-to-spend-billions-to-try-to-grab-share-of-online-gaming-market_1.png"	Bloomberry Resorts Corp. will launch its Megafunalo online gaming platform, investing ₱1-2 billion quarterly on advertising.

471-trillion-allotment-for-marcos-administrations-public-investments-eyed-in-2026-budget-proposal	₱4.71-trillion allotment for Marcos administration's public investments eyed in 2026 budget proposal	The government is looking to include 4,240 priority programs and projects (PAPs), with an investment requirement totaling about ₱4.71 trillion, in the 2026 national budget proposal to sustain public investments—especially in infrastructure and regional development.\nAccording to the Department of Economy, Planning, and Development (DEPDev), the latest update to the Public Investment Program (PIP) 2023-2028, as of March 2025, showed that 55 government offices and 225 attached agencies are seeking funding of as much as ₱19.7 trillion for 5,538 PAPs deemed as priorities of the Marcos Jr. administration.\nThe six-year PIP, tweaked every year ahead of national budget preparations for the succeeding year, contains the rolling list of PAPs to be implemented by the national government, government-owned and/or -controlled corporations (GOCCs), and other national government offices during the medium term, coinciding with the current President's term in office.\nFor 2026, the updated PIP aims to roll out the said 4,240 PAPs, of which the implementation of 930 PAPs is already ongoing, DEPDev said. Belonging to the so-called Tier 1 of budget proposal, these ongoing PAPs need funding totaling ₱3.19 trillion.\nThe smaller portion of next year's PAPs would belong to 3,310 new and expansion initiatives belonging to Tier 2, with a total investment requirement of ₱1.52 trillion.\nThe new and expansion PAPs, however, "shall be subject to availability of fiscal space," DEPDev said.\nThe Cabinet-level, interagency Development Budget Coordination Committee (DBCC) has yet to finalize the ceiling for the 2026 budget proposal, although it is expected to exceed this year's ₱6.352-trillion appropriations and reach a new record high.\n"The Expand and Upgrade Infrastructure chapter continues to have the largest share in investment targets across all 19 chapters of the PIP, amounting to ₱13.82 trillion with 2,539 priority PAPs for 2023 to 2028, and remains in line with the Marcos administration's commitment to prioritize infrastructure projects," DEPDev said.\nThe current administration's Build Better More (BBM) program is a follow-through to the previous Duterte administration's ambitious Build, Build, Build program, aimed at modernizing the country's infrastructure after many years of neglect. Investors often cite the lack of infrastructure as a major hurdle to the ease of doing business in the country.\nIn the updated PIP, investments in education, livable communities, and social protection entail a total investment of ₱3.54 trillion across 873 PAPs, DEPDev said.\nAgriculture and agribusiness modernization, meanwhile, needs ₱952.45 billion in investments across 410 PAPs, it added.\n"The PIP also includes 174 agency regional-national investment programs and projects (ARNIPAPs) endorsed by the 12 agencies following the agreements with the Regional Development Councils (RDCs) during the second regional-national investment programming (RNIP) dialogue conducted [in] August 2024. DEPDev shall be monitoring the inclusion of these ARNIPAPs in the FY [fiscal year] 2026 budget," it said.\nDEPDev explained that while the PIP 2023-2028 covers only programs and standalone projects, the updating cycle for 2026 budget preparation saw agencies submit 185 ARNIPAPs, or sub-projects.\nThe 12 original pilot national government agencies (NGAs) for ARNIPAPs are the departments of Agriculture (DA), Education (DepEd), Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), Human Settlements and Urban Development (DHSUD), Information and Communications Technology (DICT), the Interior and Local Government (DILG), Energy (DOE), Health (DOH), Science and Technology (DOST), Transportation (DOTr), Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), as well as Public Works and Highways (DPWH).\nDEPDev explained that these 12 NGAs "had the highest region-specific investment targets in the formulated PIP 2023-2028," hence were recommended by the regional offices of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), DEPDev's forerunner.\n"However, with the transfer of the National Irrigation Administration (NIA) from the DA to the Office of the President [in] September 2024, the total number of RNIP participating agencies is increased to 13," DEPDev said.

The Public Investment Program (PIP) 2023-2028 includes 5,538 priority projects totaling ₱19.7 trillion from 55 government offices and 225 agencies.  For 2026, 930 ongoing projects require ₱3.19 trillion, while 3,310 new and expansion initiatives need ₱1.52 trillion, subject to fiscal space.

adb-at-least-16-billion-investment-needed-to-establish-asean-power-grid	ADB: At least $16-billion investment needed to establish ASEAN Power Grid	In the quest to materialize the great regional grid interlink across the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Manila-based Asian Development Bank (ADB) is projecting around $16 billion (approximately ₱890 billion) worth of investments to pursue the development of key interconnections.\nDuring a media briefing on Tuesday, June 3, Keiju Mitsuhashi, energy director at the ADB, explained that various studies provide budget estimates, including findings from the ASEAN Center for Energy (ACE), which reviewed the ASEAN Power Grid master plan, and the Department of Energy (DOE), which assessed feasible investments for the Philippine grid.\n“We’re looking at, for now, [there are] 18 interconnectors in ASEAN. The estimates have been produced to be up to about $16 billion for this,” he told reporters alongside other ADB officials—director general Winfried Wicklein and Pavit Ramachandran, the ADB’s Philippines country director.\n“There are more interconnectors [that came up] as options. If you include all of these, it could be more than $16 billion. That’s a lower side of our estimates,” Mitsuhashi added.\nThe ASEAN Power Grid’s goal is to connect the electricity grids of all member countries—Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Previously, ACE also noted that there have been plans to look into the interconnection between Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines (BIMP).\nThis project would help facilitate energy sharing between countries with surplus power and those with higher demand, ultimately minimizing reliance on a single power source.\nHowever, this project shouldn’t stand alone as the answer to these nations’ power woes, as Mitsuhashi said, “The interconnection itself doesn't solve the problem. So, the grid needs to be connected with the cross-border connection, yes, but also domestic connections are the key. Because there will be a power generation site somewhere that has to go through the domestic grid and the interconnection.”\n“Roughly speaking, we estimate at least there will be a need for $100 million just for the transmission investments in the ASEAN region. So you can see the magnitude of this compared with the interconnectors. Why? Renewable energy (RE) investment has to be done within the country or in offshore, but that needs to be connected,” he added.\nAt the same time, he cited the need for enhancements within the grid capacity, as well as storage, to ensure the stability and reliability of the grid.\nPreviously, the ADB reported that limited interconnectivity of power systems has led to supply losses and technical issues, resulting in insufficient grid preparedness.\nIn 2024, the ADB reported it had committed around $3.8 billion (or approximately ₱211 billion) in energy financing. Seventy percent of this would contribute to climate mitigation and adaptation, including RE and other infrastructure projects.	"\\tImages/adb-at-least-16-billion-investment-needed-to-establish-asean-power-grid_1.png,Images/adb-at-least-16-billion-investment-needed-to-establish-asean-power-grid_2.png"	The Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates a $16 billion investment is needed for the ASEAN Power Grid, connecting 10 nations' electricity grids.  This will facilitate energy sharing and reduce reliance on single sources.  However, domestic grid connections are also crucial for success, alongside renewable energy investments and grid capacity enhancements. The ADB previously reported that limited interconnectivity has caused supply losses and technical issues.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/03/adb-at-least-16-billion-investment-needed-to-establish-asean-power-grid

bir-nbi-smash-365-million-illicit-vape-ring-in-bulacan	BIR, NBI smash ₱36.5-million illicit vape ring in Bulacan	Authorities busted an online-enabled illicit vape operation in Bulacan, seizing over 18,000 vape products and counterfeit tax stamps due to a coordinated effort between the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI).\nIn a statement, BIR Commissioner Romeo Lumagui Jr. said that the enforcement operation, conducted on May 30, was the result of extensive surveillance of online sales activities on Facebook. \nLumagui said the surveillance provided the necessary basis for the issuance of a Mission Order and a subsequent search warrant.\n“We want to send a loud and clear message to those selling illicit vape products: the BIR and NBI will pursue you wherever you hide—online or onsite. The long arms of the law extend into the cyber realm—and we will find you.” \nHe added, “We will pull out all the stops. Online or onsite, the BIR will do everything it can to stop illicit trade.”\nThe raid targeted two locations in Guiguinto, Bulacan: a vape lounge acting as a front for underground vape distribution and a makeshift warehouse located in a residential house. Inside these premises, authorities discovered 4,789 salt nicotine units and 14,022 conventional vape products, along with fake internal revenue excise stamps and counterfeit disposable vapes. \nLumagui explained the potential impact of the seizure, saying, “To put the scale of the haul into perspective—kung conservative po tayo [being conservative]—assuming one disposable vape lasts an average user one week, this means that 18,811 seized units could supply over 4,700 underage users for a month, assuming each one vapes daily.” \nHe further elaborated, “So, close to 5,000 kids could be vaping for an entire month from the products we seized in just one operation. These aren’t just tax violations—they are threats to the health of our children. That’s why we’re going after illicit traders, whether they operate in public markets or hide behind Facebook accounts and residential homes.”\nSeveral employees, including online sales agents, found during the raid are facing criminal charges alongside the proprietor. \nThese charges include multiple violations of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), specifically Sections 263 (Unlawful Possession of Articles Subject to Excise Tax Without Payment), 263-A (Sale of Vapor Products Below Combined Excise and VAT), 264 (Failure to Issue Required Receipts), 265 (Offenses Related to Counterfeit Stamps), 254 (Attempt to Evade or Defeat Tax), and 255 (Failure to Provide Accurate Tax Information). Additionally, charges under Article 172 of the Revised Penal Code (Falsification of Commercial Documents) are being prepared.\nThe BIR estimated the total deficiency tax assessment from this operation at ₱36.51 million, which includes surcharges, interest, and penalties. The basic excise tax liability from the confiscated products alone is pegged at ₱3.49 million. \nThe BIR noted that the business employed an illicit layering scheme, utilizing a mix of registered and unregistered receipts to mask illegal sales.\n However, Lumagui revealed that the BIR's new strip stamps have made it easier for agents to identify fake and untaxed products. \nHe further highlighted the significant increase in vape excise tax collections following the 2024 rollout of the digital stamp verification system. \nIn 2023, only 11.2 million milliliters of vape liquids were taxed, generating ₱223.75 million. After the stamp system's implementation in June 2024, collections surged to ₱942 million from 130 million milliliters in just one year. \nLumagui urged public vigilance, stating, “Illicit vape sellers are hiding their products in residential houses. They are hiding their illicit operations in residential communities. If you suspect that your neighbor is engaged in the selling or warehousing of illicit vape products, immediately report the same to the BIR. Illicit vape criminals have no place in our neighborhoods.”	"\\tImages/bir-nbi-smash-365-million-illicit-vape-ring-in-bulacan_1.png"	The BIR and NBI busted a ₱36.5-million illicit vape ring in Bulacan, seizing over 18,000 vape products and counterfeit stamps.

be-your-best-me	Be your "Best Me"	In today’s ever-evolving workplace environment, authenticity is becoming an increasingly important element — a cornerstone of strong, sustainable workplace culture where being a genuine self aligns with productivity.\nBased on the article published by Forbes, Reasons to Build a Positive Workplace Culture¹, supportive workplace culture boosts employee engagement, as empowered and valued employees are more likely to stay engaged. Encouraging employees to be their authentic selves, rather than suppressing their personalities, can lead to greater job satisfaction, higher motivation, and improved overall business performance. Additionally, providing employees with skills training, mentorship, and incentives significantly enhances their motivation, satisfaction, retention, and productivity — all of which contribute to stronger individual performance and long-term organizational success.\nCreating a work environment that embraces authenticity\nWhile embracing authenticity can be challenging for some organizations, McDonald’s Philippines recognizes that the modern workplace is a space not only for task execution but also for personal growth and development. As one of the leading youth employers² in the country, it remains committed to prioritizing the welfare of its employees. In line with this commitment, the company is taking action in 2025 to further strengthen a culture that encourages individuals to be the best version of themselves, captured in their message: “At McDo, I have what I need to be my Best Me.”\nWhile the work may be challenging, it also offers valuable skills, experience, and opportunities for advancement, proving that working at a fast-food restaurant is far from being a “dead-end job”³. McDonald’s strives to become more than just a fast-food serving customers their favorite meals, but a company where employees can unlock their full potential and be in their best versions. Moreover, their commitment to cultivating an inclusive and healthy work environment not only enhances the well-being of individual employees but also drives the organization’s long-term success and sustainability.\nEmpowering employees to grow, connect, and thrive together\nBuilding yourself at work can lead to greater self-discovery and contribute to a healthier work-life balance, all without compromising productivity or performance. This is an important value that employees should embrace. At the same time, employers are responsible for cultivating a workplace culture that allows individuals to grow authentically. When employees feel supported in this way, it positively impacts their well-being and the overall performance of the organization.\nMcDonald’s continues to embrace these core values through intentional people practices such as direct hiring with no contractualization and flexible work arrangements. The company ended 2024 with a network of 792 stores nationwide and employs over 65,000 individuals⁴. Seventy percent of its crew are working students, highlighting its role as a key employer of young people and its commitment to equipping them with essential skills and values for long-term success. Since 2019, the company has partnered with USAID and the Philippine Business for Education (PBEd) through the YouthWorks PH program, as part of its broader efforts to promote youth employability⁵.\nThe company ensures inclusivity and accessibility, offering opportunities to individuals from diverse backgrounds. These practices build trust and promote a sense of ownership and belonging among employees. Furthermore, McDonald’s dedication to inclusivity benefits not only working students but also reaches out to marginalized youth in the community, including those from SCDs and individuals with disabilities (PWDs). This effort is made possible through collaboration with local government units (LGUs)⁶. Through the Special Program for Employment of Students (SPES) in collaboration with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), McDonald’s provides summer job opportunities that help marginalized students support their education while gaining valuable work experience.\nAdditionally, the partnership of McDonald’s Philippines with the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) to develop the country's first TESDA-accredited training curriculum for the quick service restaurant (QSR) sector. This pioneering initiative seeks to provide more Filipinos with skills training through TESDA’s Institution-Based Training (IBT) and Enterprise-Based Training (EBT) programs, further strengthening workforce readiness in the food service industry⁷.\nIn addition, McDonald’s invests heavily in training and development programs tailored to different career stages—from foundational skills for new crew members to leadership development for aspiring managers. These programs are designed not just to improve job performance but to equip employees with life skills that extend beyond the workplace.\nThe company also offers flexible work schedules to accommodate working students, further solidifying its commitment to supporting youth employment.\nStories of growth and opportunity at McDonald’s\nStaying true to its branding theme, “Sa McDo, Easy Maging Best Me,” the company embraces a values-driven culture that fosters collaboration, mutual respect, and continuous learning. Employees are empowered to share meaningful experiences, support one another’s growth, and strive to reach their full potential. This holistic approach supports individuals to become the best version of themselves, both in and beyond the workplace.\nEmmanuel ‘Manny’ Reyes, one of the branch’s Operations Managers of McDonald’s in Laoag, Ilocos Norte.\nLongtime McDonald’s employees, such as Manny Reyes—who began as a crew member in the 1996 batch, have shared how the company has played a significant role in their lives. While balancing his studies and working at McDonald’s, he eventually earned his MBA with the company’s support — and even met his wife there. He expressed that starting as a crew member and excelling can lead to greater success. “Dala ko lagi yung motivation na ang McDonald’s magsa-start ka as a service crew pero pag pinagbuti mo, through patience and pagiging open to explore, posibleng mag-grow ka talaga at magiging successful,”(I always carry the motivation that at McDonald’s, you may start as a service crew, but if you work hard, through patience and being open to explore, it is possible to grow and be successful.)\nEric Castro, one of the Operations Managers of a McDonald’s branch.\nEric Castro, a dedicated crew member from the 1995 batch, sets an example for aspiring employees by consistently reminding them that they are essential to the company’s success. “Nagtatrabaho ka (you’re working) not because you’re obliged to, pero dahil (but because) you desire to contribute to the system, to the organization.”\nSariah ‘Aya’ Guillermo, one of the Operations Managers of a McDonald’s branch.\nAya Guillermo, from the 2005 batch and an aspiring graduate from a university in Hawaii, returned home to pursue her dream of being part of a global company with high international standards. Her experience working at McDonald’s led her to say that it is a place where you can build a career—an opportunity to grow, discover yourself, and develop your skills. “McDonald’s loves their people very much. They care for their people very much. That’s why I can’t leave the company because they are a people company,” she said.\nJeq Singson, one of the Operations Managers of a McDonald’s branch.\nFor Jeq Singson, a member of the 1998 batch, her time at McDonald’s is her longest-lasting relationship, with the company's values consistently matching her own. Her work ethic strengthened as she continued working at the company, building discipline, responsibility, and resilience. Her hard work and dedication opened up more opportunities and demonstrated her potential to the company. “The thing with McDo, if they see your potential and you're hard working too, they will bring out the best in you,” she stated.\nThese reflections from inspiring crew members who have risen to success and now serve as Operations Managers, handling greater responsibilities, highlight how McDonald’s stands as a strong example of an employer that goes beyond conventional workplace norms.

ai-weather-forecasting-to-empower-filipino-farmers-against-climate-shifts	AI weather forecasting to empower Filipino farmers against climate shifts	United States-based global weather intelligence firm Tomorrow.io is set to bring its artificial intelligence (AI) technology in the Philippines to help farmers to rapidly shifting climate conditions that often hamper productivity.\nTomorrow.io, a known technology provider for American government agencies, said it has solidified a collaboration with the National Irrigation Administration (NIA) and the Department of Agriculture (DA).\nThe company said the partnership is expected to transform farming through the use of weather forecasting, harnessing its AI models and proprietary network of low-orbit satellites.\nEssentially, the satellites collects high-resolution atmospheric data, which physics-based and AI-powered models then process to deliver highly accurate forecasts.\nThese forecasts are then translated into predictive insights through a scalable software platform, enabling proactive risk management across industries.\nIn agriculture, the technology will enable micro-weather at the plot level, bringing precise and timely agronomy advice, such as when to delay irrigation based on incoming rainfall.\nTomorrow.io Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Shimon Elkabetz said its technology is uniquely positioned to serve the Philippines’ diverse archipelago and remote farming communities.\n“Our proprietary space-based satellite constellation was purpose-built to fill those coverage gaps and provide  high-resolution, real-time weather intelligence across the country, even in the most hard-to-reach and underserved areas,” said Elkabetz.\nThe company said introducing its technology comes at a critical time for the country with the arrival of the rainy season, with habagat or southwest monsoon already affecting various parts of the country.\nBased on data from the DA, the agriculture sector suffered ₱57.78 billion in damages due to weather disturbances last year.\nThis affected over 1.4 million farmers and fishers, as well as the loss of 2.19 million metric tons (MT) of production across nearly one million hectares.\nElkabetz is optimistic that the company’s weather technology will help farmers in the country brace for adverse climate conditions.\n“Tomorrow.io ensures truly national coverage. This allows for faster, more accurate early warnings, empowering farmers and local industries to make informed decisions during severe weather events” he added.\nElkabetz said the weather data it will gather should enable farmers to make informed decisions, especially in managing inputs, mitigating weather-related losses, and enhancing yields.\nAside from agriculture, he noted that the company may soon extend its services to other industries such as shipping and aviation, where accurate weather data is critical.\nGlobally, Tomorrow.io is being utilized in several development efforts, including the programs of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation programs in Africa.	"\\tImages/ai-weather-forecasting-to-empower-filipino-farmers-against-climate-shifts_1.png"	Tomorrow.io's AI weather technology will help Filipino farmers adapt to climate change and improve productivity.  The technology uses low-orbit satellites and AI models to provide highly accurate forecasts. This will enable precise agronomy advice, such as when to irrigate, mitigating weather-related losses.

trade-shocks-could-erode-philippines-progress-if-left-unchecked	Trade shocks could 'erode' Philippines' progress if left unchecked	If trade shocks are left unchecked, they could potentially inflict greater damage on Philippine growth, compromising the country’s significant progress in recent years, according to a top official of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP).\n“In particular, trade shocks affect the capital stock of developing economies. Left unchecked, they can slow growth trajectories and erode decades of hard-won progress,” Zeno Ronald R. Abenoja, BSP deputy governor for the monetary and economics sector (MES), said during a policy forum on navigating United States (US)-imposed reciprocal tariffs.\n“Today, unprecedented policy shocks are fueling a befuddling kind of uncertainty,” Abenoja said.\nAbout two months after US President Donald Trump slapped a 17-percent reciprocal tariff on Philippine exports, local leaders are still in negotiations with the US.\n“Monetary policy alone cannot fully shield the economy from the repercussions of these shocks,” Abenoja said.\nBSP Governor Eli M. Remolona Jr. had said that “unfortunately,” monetary policy does not have the tools for those trade shocks. He earlier warned that trade shocks are more damaging than supply shocks, which monetary policy is not equipped to address.\nMeanwhile, “broader, coordinated strategies would indeed help,” Abenoja noted. “Fortunately, the Philippine economy is now well-positioned to manage inflation.”\nApril inflation stood at 1.4 percent, the slowest in over five years, or since November 2019. It also fell within the lower end of the BSP’s forecast range of 1.3 percent to 2.1 percent.\nAbenoja stressed that the softer inflation “gives us extra degrees of freedom to ease monetary policy, which in turn can support growth.”\nTo date, the central bank has reduced key borrowing costs by a total of 100 basis points (bps) to 5.5 percent from 6.5 percent before the easing cycle started in August last year. Remolona said last week that the BSP could cut further “maybe” by two more cuts. If realized, the key interest rate would settle at five percent this year.\nThe local economy accelerated by 5.4 percent in the first quarter of 2025, almost stagnant compared to the 5.3-percent growth posted in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). The government blamed this sluggish growth on the 19.9-percent decline in net exports.\n“The BSP stands ready to do what is necessary to keep inflation steady and maintain the country's macroeconomic stability,” Abenoja said.	"\\tImages/26-trade-shocks-could-erode-philippines-progress-if-left-unchecked_1.png"	Unchecked trade shocks could severely damage Philippine growth, eroding years of progress, according to a BSP official.  Monetary policy alone can't fully protect the economy from these shocks; broader strategies are needed.  April inflation was at a five-year low, offering some flexibility to ease monetary policy and support growth.  Sluggish first-quarter 2025 growth was partly attributed to a significant decline in net exports.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/05/26/trade-shocks-could-erode-philippines-progress-if-left-unchecked

Isla will serve as chief advisor during the leadership transition to ensure a smooth handover.\nAirAsia Aviation Group Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Bo Lingam said Bangah’s extensive management and industry experience makes him well-positioned to build on the strong foundations laid by his predecessor.\n“Captain Suresh steps into this role at an important juncture. As AirAsia progresses into our next chapter, the Philippines remains a key pillar in our regional strategy,” said Lingam.\nLingam noted that the airline’s Philippine operations carry strong potential in inter-island connectivity and broader regional integration into Southeast Asia and North Asia.\nBangah is taking over the captain’s seat with a vision to enter a new era of sustainable and profitable growth, while aligning the airline closely with the country and local stakeholders.\n“We’re firmly aligned with national efforts to grow the aviation and tourism sectors—from meeting rising demand for travel to supporting connectivity and infrastructure developments that will shape the future of travel in the Philippines,” said Bangah.\n“At the same time, we remain focused on addressing key external challenges—including global supply chain delays affecting aircraft maintenance, rising fuel costs, higher airport charges, and environmental factors that can impact operations,” he added.\nAfter flying approximately seven million guests last year, AirAsia Philippines is set to enter its next phase of growth with a plan to expand its operational fleet to 19 aircraft.\nThe carrier said this move will boost capacity to meet the rising demand while sustaining a 90-percent seat load factor this year.\n“These ambitions are underpinned by a group-wide strategy to elevate the end-to-end guest experience through digitally enabled services and ancillary innovations,” it said.

These results highlight the effectiveness of our strategic initiatives and the resilience of our core business.”\nRevenues rose 14.6 percent to ₱70.23 billion while operating income grew by 17.6 percent to ₱4.8 billion despite a 56.2 percent increase in advertising and promotions.\nHowever, attributable net income declined by 8.1 percent to ₱2.41 billion in the first quarter of 2025, from ₱2.62 billion in the same period last year, driven by higher below-the-line items.\n“On a quarter-on-quarter basis both operating income and attributable net income increased by double digits. While attributable net income was slightly lower year-over-year, this was primarily due to non-operational factors.\n“Looking ahead, the Jollibee Group expects continued strong operational performance, and we remain proactive in managing macroeconomic and financial headwinds. We are confident in our strategy and execution, and, accordingly, we are reaffirming our full year guidance,” Shin said.\nJollibee expects to deliver an eight percent to 12 percent growth in system wide sales in 2025, with four percent to six percent growth in same store sales and store network growth of four percent to eight percent. Operating profit growth will be in the range of 10 percent to 15 percent.

cebu-pacific-leases-aircraft-to-saudi-low-cost-carrier-flyadeal-amid-seasonal-lull	Cebu Pacific leases aircraft to Saudi low-cost carrier Flyadeal amid seasonal lull	Gokongwei-led Cebu Pacific has signed a wet-lease agreement with Flyadeal, the low-cost unit of the Saudia Group, which will see the country’s leading budget carrier lease out its aircraft during the anticipated weak period in the third quarter.\nShaping up to be the beginning of a landmark agreement, Cebu Pacific and Flyadeal formalized their collaboration in a signing of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on Wednesday, May 28.\nThe agreement will push the two low-cost carriers to explore joint strategic initiatives, spanning cooperations in commercial operations to maintenance and engineering.\nOne of these collaborations is Flyadeal’s upcoming utilization of two of Cebu Pacific’s Airbus A320 aircraft on a wet-lease arrangement during the peak flying season in Saudi Arabia.\nCebu Pacific Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Mike Szucs said the Saudi carrier will operate the aircraft for two months, beginning June 20, coinciding with the lean flying season of the Philippines.\nAs a highly seasonal market, the Philippines routinely sees a low period every third quarter of the year, during which the rainy season typically begins alongside the opening of classes.\nCebu Pacific reported that its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin fell to a mere one percent in the third quarter of 2024, way below the 11-percent average in the other quarters.\nThe wet-lease deal with Flyadeal will mark the first time Cebu Pacific leases out its planes to a foreign airline for commercial operations.\nTypically, local airlines lease aircraft from foreign operators to address capacity needs. Last year, Cebu Pacific brought in two aircraft from Bulgaria Air for the first quarter.\nThe new deal will see Cebu Pacific’s aircraft, crew, and maintenance operate the two leased aircraft. An Arabic employee is expected to be on board to supplement customer engagement during a flight.\nBoth aircraft are expected to bolster Flyadeal’s domestic reach to the bustling cities of Jeddah, Riyadh, Dammam, and Abha.\nSzucs said the agreement with Flyadeal is currently one-off, with the potential to increase the number of aircraft in future agreements.\nSince this will be the first foray of Cebu Pacific into the Middle Eastern country, Flyadeal is already deep into the regulatory process to get the deal and the airline certified by the kingdom’s authorities.\nReciprocally, Cebu Pacific is examining wet-leasing A320s from Flyadeal during the busy winter period in Southeast Asia, which aligns with the holiday period over the fourth quarter of the year.\nIts fleet of aircraft performing at strong capacity year-round is part of the airline’s strategy to significantly grow passenger volume in 2025 by 15 to 20 percent.\nLast year, Cebu Pacific carried an all-time high 24.5 million passengers, up 17 percent from 20.9 million in 2023.\nWith 98 aircraft already under its arsenal, the carrier is set to increase it to 100 by the year-end.\nFlyadeal, which was only launched in 2017, currently has a fleet of 38 aircraft, connecting passengers to over 40 destinations domestically and in nearby countries.\nFlyadeal CEO Steven Greenway said agreements such as the wet-lease deal with Cebu Pacific will help the airline play a crucial role in Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 program.\nBy 2030, the kingdom is looking to be the Middle East’s top aviation hub, welcoming over 150 million tourists annually.\nAside from the lease agreement, Greenway said the two airlines could also consider code-sharing in the future.\n“We'll probably work our way around through that and see what we can do,” he said.	"\\tImages/cebu-pacific-leases-aircraft-to-saudi-low-cost-carrier-flyadeal-amid-seasonal-lull_1.png"	Cebu Pacific is leasing two Airbus A320 aircraft to Saudi Arabia's Flyadeal for two months, starting June 20, to offset the Philippines' third-quarter seasonal lull. This marks Cebu Pacific's first aircraft lease to a foreign airline for commercial operations.

The prescribed procedure involves updating risk assessments based on emerging financial threats.\nA bank must update its assessments on “newly identified financial crime threats and emerging trends relevant to its products and services.”\nBanks are also told to include relevant anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) trends that “may have an impact on its operations and affected controls.”\nBanks and financial institutions are also instructed to regularly update their list of sources for NMRs and maintain a database of individuals or entities flagged in such reports. These sources may include news articles, public registries, court and legislative records, as well as widely reported hearings and investigations.\nAdditionally, banks are expected to step up background checks by screening for negative news during customer onboarding and transaction reviews, including checks on ultimate beneficial owners and key business partners.\nDepending on the findings, they may need to apply stricter monitoring, limit account access, or even end relationships. Banks must also have strong internal systems to alert senior management and the board about major risks.

allianz-sees-philippine-insurance-premiums-tripling-by-2035-with-life-sector-growing-by-95	Allianz sees Philippine insurance premiums tripling by 2035, with life sector growing by 9.5%	With 8.1-billion-euros worth of insurance premiums last year in the Philippines, Germany-based Allianz predicts it will bloat by 9.2 percent annually over the next decade, reaching 21.4 billion euros or about ₱1.33 trillion by 2035.\nAllianz Research said in its Global Insurance Report 2025 published Wednesday, May 27, that it “remains confident about life insurance [globally], which can expect annual growth of five percent thanks to higher interest rates.” It is looking at 9.5-percent growth for the Philippine life insurance industry.\nFor property and casualty (P&C) belonging to the non-life sector, Allianz Research expects an annual growth of 8.3 percent through 2035, faster than the global average of 4.5 percent.\n“The segment will show solid growth rates in almost all markets, as the increasing need for protection is a global phenomenon,” the report said.\nReports showed that the gross written premiums (GWP)—total premium income before deductions like reinsurance or cancellations—of the country’s life insurance industry stood at 5.56 billion euros in 2024. This accounted for 68.6 percent of the total premiums last year.\nBased on the Allianz Global Insurance Map, this translates to about 46.7 euros per individual during the year.\nLife insurance premiums accounted for 1.2 percent of 2024 gross domestic product (GDP).\nLife insurance posted the highest annual growth of 13.4 percent in three years, since the 22.8-percent growth rate seen during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. There were slight contractions in 2022 and 2023.\nMeanwhile, the P&C insurance segment had collected a total of 2.16 billion euros in 2024, making up 26.7 percent of the total. This translates to just 18.1 euros per policy holder.\nThe P&C insurance segment expanded by 10.5 percent, faster than the 8.6-percent growth in 2023, but a tad slower than the 10.6-percent growth in 2022. It has been accounting for 0.5 percent of the country’s GDP since 2007.\nAdditionally, the industry’s premium income for the health insurance segment stood at 400 million euros, accounting for the remaining five percent of the total. It translates to just 3.3 euros per account holder.

boc-seizes-12-smuggled-vehicles-from-us-declared-as-car-parts	BOC seizes 12 smuggled vehicles from US declared as car parts	The Bureau of Customs (BOC) has intercepted two shipments containing 12 smuggled motor vehicles that arrived at the Manila International Container Port (MICP) from the United States (US).\nBOC-Customs Intelligence and Investigation Services Director Verne Enciso stated that the shipments were subjected to x-ray imaging at the MICP after derogatory information was received, indicating they contained "misdeclared and undeclared items."\n"The x-ray imaging on-site revealed that the shipments, which were declared to contain assorted car accessories and supply, actually have 12 motor vehicles inside,” Enciso said.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“That led to a request for an issuance of alert order so the CIIS MICP can conduct a thorough 100 percent physical examination of the containers," he added.\nThe two intercepted shipments included one unit of 1996 Acura Integra, three units of 1998 Honda Civic, one unit of 1999 Honda Civic, four units of 2000 Honda Civic, one unit of 2002 Honda S2000, one unit of 2004 Honda S2000, and one unit of 2007 Mini Cooper S. \n"We had solid information that these shipments may be smuggling motor vehicles into our country under the guise of importing car accessories and parts. This is why our officers have been hard at work these past weeks to verify the information our intelligence unit received and apply the proper seizure procedures,” BOC Deputy Commissioner for Intelligence Group Juvymax Uy said.\nBOC Commissioner Bienvenido Y. Rubio, meanwhile, assured that those involved in the smuggling operation will face legal consequences. \nHe stated, "These are in clear violation of Section 1400 of the Customs Modernization and Tariff Act. The bureau will file the appropriate cases and make sure that these organizations will be held responsible. The BOC is not beating around the bush.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“We have an all-hands-on-deck approach and we are ready to use all our resources—both technical and technology—to get to the bottom of these smuggling activities,” he added.

aussie-mining-business-mission-coming-in-h2-2025-to-explore-philippine-opportunities-amid-renewed-interest	Aussie mining business mission coming in H2 2025 to explore Philippine opportunities amid 'renewed interest'	A business delegation composed of at least 20 Australian mining companies will come to the Philippines in the second half of 2025 to explore opportunities amid renewed interest among foreign investors in the extractive sector.\n"There will always be plenty of business missions [from Australia]. We are, in fact, organizing a mining business mission," outgoing Australian Ambassador to the Philippines Hae Kyong (HK) Yu told reporters on the sidelines of the Philippines-Australia Friendship Festival on Saturday, June 7.\nThis will be a follow-through to the four Australian business missions brought to the Philippines in the past over one year, Yu said.\nWhile the upcoming mining delegation is still in the works, Yu said she expects about 20 to 30 Australian firms to participate, similar to the number of companies in the previous business missions.\nWhile Yu did not name specific Australian miners, she said industry bodies Down Under have an "enormous amount of interest" in the Philippines."\nThe ambassador noted that the ban on new mining agreements was lifted only recently—in 2021, under Executive Order (EO) No. 130 signed by former President Rodrigo Duterte. Some local government units (LGUs), however, still impose their own mining moratoriums.\n"As soon as the [national mining] moratorium was lifted, the Australian Embassy has been very active in pursuing these relationships," Yu said.\nShe said that while interest in the Philippines' mining industry may not just be coming from Australian companies but from all over the globe, "Australia has a particular interest in it, because we are good at mining."\n"We have a track record in showing the Philippines how mining can be done—so that it's sustainable, it's actually responsible, and the profits are shared with the community and with the country."\nMaharlika Investment Corp. (MIC), which manages the Philippines' first sovereign wealth fund (SWF), earlier said that SWFs abroad are also eyeing the Philippines' mining sector.\nMIC President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Rafael D. Consing Jr. told Manila Bulletin last month that as an SWF "near Asia" is keenly looking into the country's extractive space, MIC could serve as a vehicle for mining co-investments.\nMIC could also be a platform to consolidate a pipeline of all viable mining developments in the country, which may likewise be offered to other SWFs and other interested parties for co-investments, according to Consing.\nThe MIC chief sees mining as potentially emerging as the Philippine economy's fifth pillar, after semiconductor and electronics exports, overseas Filipino workers' (OFWs) remittances, business process outsourcing (BPO), and tourism.\nBut Consing had noted that despite the Philippines claiming to be the fifth most mineralized country in the world, the mining industry only contributed a "disproportionate" less than one percent to gross domestic product (GDP).\nTo date, MIC is venturing into mining through a forthcoming $76.4-million bridge loan to Makilala Mining Co. Inc., which plans to kick-start early development works for the Maalinao-Caigutan-Biyog (MCB) copper-gold project in Kalinga province.\nWhile Consing did not provide details, as the project's foreign partners are listed firms in the Australian and London stock markets, he had said MIC underwent "exceptional due diligence" to ensure that the upcoming venture not only has significant economic potential but also responsible design.	"\\tImages/aussie-mining-business-mission-coming-in-h2-2025-to-explore-philippine-opportunities-amid-renewed-interest_1.png"	At least 20 Australian mining companies will explore Philippine opportunities in a business mission during H2 2025.  This follows four previous missions in the past year, reflecting renewed global interest in the sector after a moratorium was lifted in 2021.  Australia's expertise in sustainable and responsible mining is highlighted, aiming for community and national profit-sharing.  Maharlika Investment Corp. (MIC) also sees potential for significant economic growth in the Philippine mining industry.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/09/aussie-mining-business-mission-coming-in-h2-2025-to-explore-philippine-opportunities-amid-renewed-interest

maynilad-ipo-sees-encouraging-early-investor-feedback-for-p458-billion-offering	Maynilad IPO sees 'encouraging' early investor feedback for ₱45.8-billion offering	Maynilad Water Services Inc. reported that feedback from preliminary investor meetings has been encouraging for its planned initial public offering, valued at up to ₱45.8 billion.\nIn a letter to the Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corporation, Maynilad Corporate Information Officer Lourdes Marivic K. Punzalan-Espiritu stated that the company has held preliminary investor meetings as part of its standard and customary market engagement.\nHowever, she noted that “no pricing feedback has been sought or obtained” and that “the formal price discovery process has not commenced.”\n“Maynilad has not yet entered the book-building phase; accordingly, there is no basis for assessing investor demand or determining price ranges at this stage,” Espiritu said.\nIt was reported earlier this week that stock analysts have heard that Maynilad may lower its offer price range to between ₱12.00 and ₱14.00 per share, down from its initially indicated maximum offer price of ₱20 per share, based on investor interest.\nHowever, Abacus Securities Corporation said it believes there is sufficient demand for Maynilad’s IPO shares at ₱14 per share since the projected dividend yield of 6.5 percent at such level would be higher than those of other large-cap stocks listed in the Philippine Stock Exchange.\nAnother stock analyst pointed out that, while there is no official announcement on the price yet, “among us analysts, I would say consensus is around ₱12.00 to ₱14.00 per share.”\n“I prefer a lower price (to ₱20 per share). It offers a discount to investors, pricing uncertainty despite (Maynilad’s) business being cyclical as a utility,” said Jonathan Ravelas, senior adviser at Reyes Tacandong & Co.\nRizal Commercial Banking Corporation Chief Economist Michael L. Ricafort pointed out that, the issuer is expected to seek the highest price possible to maximize funds raised through the stock market although this also depends on market conditions and investors’ appetite.\n“It is so important to have favorable timing especially during times of improved market sentiment. It is a delicate balancing act on the time when funding is needed and also to meet the deadline for listing and fund-raising,” he added.\nBased on the prospectus, the final offering price will be announced on June 30, 2025 while the offer period is tentatively set to run from July 3 to July 9, 2025 while listing date is targeted for July 17, 2025.\nBased on its preliminary prospectus, Maynilad is offering a total of 2.29 billion shares consisiting of a primary offer of 1.66 billion new common shares, a preferential offer to First Pacific Company of 24.9 million new shares, an upsize option of 354.7 million secondary shares of shares owned by exisiting shareholders, and an overallotment option of up to 249.05 million shares.\nProceeds from the offering of new shares will be used to fund Maynilad’s capital expenditure program for 2025-2026 which consists of three major pillars: water capex, wastewater capex, and customer service and information system projects capex. A portion of the proceeds may also be allocated for general corporate purposes.

deposit-insurance-adds-another-layer-of-protection-to-hard-earned-profits	Deposit insurance adds another layer of protection to hard-earned profits	A sari-sari store around the corner, eateries lining up on the side of a street, 24/7 community laundry shop, or a digital marketing start-up agency are just a few examples of MSMEs or micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises that play a crucial role in providing employment and driving economic growth.\nData from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) showed that for 2023, 99.63% of the total recorded business enterprises operating in the country are MSMEs.\nAngela started her baking business both as a side-hustle and as an outlet for her love for desserts, initially offering her baked goods to family and colleagues. When the pandemic shifted how people do business that led to the rise of e-commerce, Angela also explored using social media to widen the reach of her business.\n“Mahirap na umasa lang sa buwan-buwan na sahod. Kailangan maging madiskarte dahil sa pangangailangan ng pamilya, kaya sumubok ako sa pag-nenegosyo. Naisip ko dahil mahilig naman ako mag-bake, bakit ‘di ko subukan? Ino-offer ko lang nung umpisa sa mga kamag-anak, kakilala, at mga katrabaho, hanggang sa nagpo-post na rin ako sa social media. Ngayon ay nag-iisip ako na mapalago pa lalo ang negosyo, (It's hard to rely only on the monthly salary. You have to be resourceful because of the needs of the family, that’s why I decided to try starting a business. Since I love baking, I thought, why not give it a shot? At first, I offered my baked goods to family, friends, and co-workers. Then, I started posting about it on social media. Now, I’m thinking of growing the business even more),” Angela shared of her business journey, thus far.\nFor business owners like Angela, having a savings account is important if they want to grow their business. First, saving in banks provides business owners access to credit, which will come in handy if they want to apply for a loan to finance their business operations or plans for expansion. Second, it gives them access to bank products and tools that will make transactions with suppliers and customers easier. More importantly, it ensures business owners’ hard-earned profits are secured in banks.\nAdding another layer of security and protection to bank deposits is deposit insurance provided by the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC). The PDIC insures deposits in banks licensed to operate by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP).\nMany MSMEs and start-ups, including Angela, have gravitated towards digital transactions and even mobile apps, which have become increasingly popular in the country due to factors that make banking more convenient and rewarding.\n“At the end of each month, sinisiguro ko na may naitatabi rin ako sa bangko. Ngayon ay meron akong dalawang savings account, isa sa traditional bank at isa sa digital bank. Unti-unti kong binubuo ang capital para sa pangarap na mapalaki pa ang aking baking business. Sa pag-iipon sa bangko, panatag ako na secured ang negosyo goals ko. (At the end of each month, I make sure to set aside some savings in the bank. Right now, I maintain two savings accounts, one in a traditional bank and another in a digital bank. Little by little, I’m saving up the capital I need to grow my baking business. Saving in the bank gives me peace of mind, knowing my business goals are secure),” Angela said with optimism.\nThe new maximum deposit insurance coverage (MDIC) of ₱1 million took effect on March 15, 2025. This upward adjustment in the MDIC since it was last set to ₱500,000 in 2009, offers greater protection for bank deposits and grants individuals and business owners, like Angela, more peace of mind and confidence that their hard-earned deposits in banks are safe and secure.\nTo learn more about the new MDIC, you may visit http://www.pdic.gov.ph/MDIC target=_blank>www.pdic.gov.ph/MDIC.

marcos-admin-posts-673-billion-budget-surplus-in-april-on-higher-tax-collections	Marcos admin posts ₱67.3-billion budget surplus in April on higher tax collections	The national government recorded a budget surplus of ₱67.3 billion in April, marking a 57.5 percent jump from the same month last year, as tax collections rose by 7.8 percent—boosted by stronger revenue from corporate, personal income, and value-added taxes (VAT) collected by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR).\nThe Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) reported that total revenue collections in April reached ₱522.1 billion, showing a slight 2.8-percent drop due to the timing of non-tax collections. However, this was balanced by a strong 7.8-percent increase in tax revenues.\nThe government’s collections for the first four months totaled ₱1.5 trillion, rising by 3.4 percent or ₱49.3 billion from the same period in 2024.\nData showed that this growth was mainly driven by an 11.5-percent increase in tax revenues, which made up 94 percent of total collections, while non-tax revenues accounted for the remaining six percent.\nGiven this performance, the Marcos administration said it is “on track to hit its collection goals this year.”\nThe BIR, the country’s largest revenue collection agency, collected ₱420.5 billion during the month, marking an 11.1-percent increase compared to last year.\nAccording to the BTr, this uptick in the BIR collections was driven by “higher collections from corporate income tax (CIT), VAT, and personal income tax (PIT).”\n“The surge in CIT collections was primarily due to the annual tax filing deadline for corporations in April. Meanwhile, PIT and VAT collections improved on the back of the BIR’s intensified efforts to simplify tax filing through enhanced digital services,” it further said.\nThese measures, combined with increased excise tax revenues, boosted the BIR’s year-to-date collections to P1.1 trillion, which climbed by 14.5 percent from last year.\nMeanwhile, the Bureau of Customs (BOC), the country’s second-largest revenue-collecting agency, collected ₱74.7 billion in April. It dropped by 7.5 percent compared to last year, “partly due to the fewer working days for the month and the impact of lower import volumes amidst global trade challenges.”\nHowever, the BTs noted that the BOC’s overall collection for the four-month period reached ₱306.1 billion, exceeding last year’s performance by 2.2 percent.\nNon-tax revenues in April also dropped to ₱24.1 billion year on year, down 68.1 percent from 2024. The government blamed this decline on government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs) that mostly have not yet remitted dividends, unlike last year.\nAs such non-tax collections as of end-April stood at ₱90.7 billion, 51.9-percent lower than last year’s four-month total of ₱188.8 billion.\nEnd-April budget shortfall\nThe Marcos administration, meanwhile, posted a cumulative budget deficit of ₱411.5 billion, widening nearly 79 percent from the same period last year. The Treasury said this was due to a faster 13.6-percent increase in public spending aimed at fueling the economy and supporting priority programs of the Marcos Jr. administration.\nMeanwhile, expenditures for April slowed by eight percent, totaling ₱454.8 billion compared to ₱494.5 billion last year. The decrease was “largely due to lower interest payments and subsidies to government corporations, particularly for the National Irrigation Administration (NIA).\nAdditionally, the timing of the capitalization transfer for the coconut farmers and industry trust fund affected April’s spending growth, as this transfer happened in March this year but in April last year.\nBut still, cumulative disbursements for the year still grew by 13.6 percent, reaching ₱1.93 trillion.\nPrimary spending in April amounted to ₱408.3 billion, down 4.4 percent from last year’s level of ₱427.0 billion. Meanwhile, total primary spending for the first four months of the year reached P1.6 trillion, reflecting a 14.2-percent increase from the same period last year.\nInterest payments during the month stood at ₱46.4 billion, down 31.2 percent year-on-year, mainly due to changes in the timing of payments for domestic and foreign loans during the holidays.\nBut total interest payments as of end-April soared to ₱287.4 billion, marking a 10.4-percent increase from last year.	"\\tImages/marcos-admin-posts-673-billion-budget-surplus-in-april-on-higher-tax-collections_1.png"	April's budget surplus reached ₱67.3 billion, a 57.5% increase from last year, driven by a 7.8% rise in tax collections.  Total revenue collections reached ₱522.1 billion in April, despite a slight drop in non-tax collections.  The Marcos administration is on track to meet its collection goals, with year-to-date collections exceeding last year's performance.

meralco-awaits-doe-nod-for-800-mw-power-supply-auctions	Meralco awaits DOE nod for 800-MW power supply auctions	Manila Electric Company (Meralco) is awaiting the Department of Energy's (DOE) approval to proceed with its planned competitive selection processes (CSPs) this year, which aim to procure power through transparent and cost-effective means.\nIn an interview, Larry Fernandez, head of utility economics at Meralco, explained that the company is seeking the DOE’s issuance of the Certificate of Conformity (CoC), a requirement under DOE policy before initiating new power supply bidding. This CoC essentially provides the go-signal for the company to begin publication for the CSP.\n“Meralco has yet to receive this for two proposed CSPs: the 200-megawatt (MW) renewable energy baseload supply starting January 26, 2026, and the 600-MW baseload supply starting February 26, 2028,” he said.\nBaseload power plants are designed to run continuously, providing a steady, reliable supply of electricity to meet the minimum demand on the grid. In contrast, mid-merit plants are utilized when electricity demand fluctuates, typically operating during moderate demands to provide grid flexibility.\nThese CSPs were initially scheduled for April and May this year. However, due to the delays, Meralco hopes to obtain the certification to begin the selective bidding.\nThis development follows Meralco's announcement of plans to begin the CSP that would secure more than 2,100 MW of capacity under its long-term supply procurement plan from 2026 to 2046.

higher-domestic-borrowings-push-govt-debt-to-record-167-trillion-in-april	Higher domestic borrowings push gov't debt to record ₱16.7 trillion in April	The total outstanding debt of the government reached a new record high of ₱16.75 trillion in April, an increase of ₱68.7 billion, or 0.4 percent, from the previous month, driven by higher domestic borrowings amid strong demand for government securities.\nLatest data from the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) showed the government’s total debt reached ₱16.75 trillion in April, up by ₱68.7 billion. This translates to a 0.4-percent increase month on month.\nFurther rise was “minimized by the significant appreciation of the peso, which reduced the effect of additional borrowings in line with the fiscal program,” the BTr said in a statement released on Tuesday, June 3.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn particular, the peso’s appreciation trimmed the value of dollar-denominated domestic securities by ₱3.85 billion.\nThe BTr said that the government continues to follow “a disciplined debt strategy, ensuring that borrowings support productive investments while keeping fiscal sustainability.”\n“The fiscal deficit has also been steadily narrowing and is on track to drop to about 3.8 percent by 2028,” it added.\nAs of end-April 2025, domestic debt climbed 1.85 percent to ₱11.59 trillion from the previous month. This was due to the “strong demand for government securities, including ₱300 billion in benchmark bonds.”\nMeanwhile, foreign debt dropped to ₱5.16 trillion for the first four months, marking a 2.7-percent decline from March. This drop was mainly due to the peso’s appreciation, which reduced the value of foreign debt by P124.7 billion, along with net repayments amounting to ₱58.3 billion.\nIn the first four months, domestic debt made up 69.2 percent of the total debt stock, while foreign debt accounted for 30.8 percent. While it slightly improved from the previous month’s ratio, this fell short of the 80:20 borrowing ratio—80 percent of total debt from local lenders and 20 percent from foreign creditors.\nThe government lowered its borrowings to ₱1.14 trillion from January to April 2025, down by ₱28 billion from last year’s ₱1.16 trillion, mainly due to the massive decline in borrowings from local lenders.\nFor this year, the Marcos administration plans to borrow a total of ₱2.55 trillion from both domestic and foreign lenders to plug a projected budget shortfall of ₱1.54 trillion, which would be equivalent to 5.3 percent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP).\nOf this amount, ₱2.04 trillion will be borrowed from domestic creditors, while ₱510 billion is planned to be borrowed from foreign sources.	"\\tImages/higher-domestic-borrowings-push-govt-debt-to-record-167-trillion-in-april_1.png"	The Philippine government's debt hit a record high of ₱16.75 trillion in April, a 0.4% increase from March due to higher domestic borrowings.  The peso's appreciation reduced the value of dollar-denominated debt, minimizing the overall increase. Domestic debt climbed to ₱11.59 trillion while foreign debt decreased to ₱5.16 trillion.  The government aims to borrow ₱2.55 trillion this year to address the budget shortfall.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/03/higher-domestic-borrowings-push-govt-debt-to-record-167-trillion-in-april
cic-discussing-partnership-with-san-miguel-for-naia-rehabilitation	CIC discussing partnership with San Miguel for NAIA rehabilitation	Concepcion Industrial Corporation (CIC), the country’s leading provider of consumer lifestyle and enterprise solutions, is discussing with San Miguel Corporation its possible participation in the rehabilitation of the three terminals of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport.\nIn a discussion with members of the media, CIC Chairman and President Raul Joseph A. Concepcion stated that they have already held talks with SMC Chairman and CEO Ramon S. Ang on how to improve the overall experience for travelers going through NAIA.\n“When RSA said ‘I want to give our passengers the best experience,’ even behind closed doors, he meant that. So, what will make our passengers in Naia experience a better life going there and coming back? We find ourselves in an advantage because number one, we're co-designing it,” Concepcion said.\nFor NAIA terminals, he said they will conduct an audit of their air conditioning and other systems, including elevators and escalators, to determine if they are installed with sufficient capacity to support the current airport usage.\nFor instance, Concepcion pointed out that airports are similar to large malls, and there are restaurants inside, so the cooling system will also need to consider the heat generated by these restaurants when cooking food.\n“As you can see on the solutions…we're very strong in commercial (air conditioners), elevators, escalators, building management systems, and then eventually moving to other things as far as security, lightning, and then smart security systems…\n“Today, we have end-to-end capabilities that allows us to focus on providing a one-stop solution for both homes and businesses,” he said noting that in the Philippines, there are only one or two companies with the capability to provide solutions for large developments like airports, malls, and integrated resorts.\nHe added that, “not only can we go in, we can install, we can service, we can replace, and then go to the engineering, science, and everything.”\nCIC Chief Executive Officer Isias Ariel P. Fermin said that, aside from redesigning NAIA with SMC, they are also going to help in the rehabilitation of other airports in the country.\n“A lot of the nation's airport, even Cebu, we do. Some of the iconic buildings out there: malls, hotels, casinos. Some of the nation's landmarks or buildings,” Concepcion added.\nFermin said CIC does not just design the system and then buy and install the equipment but also, “we're going to help you maintain that. We're going to tell you that we have the parts even after 10 to 15 years.\nThat is the progress by which we develop the solution.”	"\\tImages/cic-discussing-partnership-with-san-miguel-for-naia-rehabilitation_1.png"	Concepcion Industrial Corporation (CIC) is discussing a partnership with San Miguel Corporation (SMC) to rehabilitate Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA).

The 200 or 250 MW is baseload renewable energy (RE), and the 600 MW is also baseload,” he explained.\nThe CSP enables distribution utilities (DUs) like Meralco to procure power through transparent and cost-effective mechanisms.\nMeralco had previously indicated its need for government certification as it intended to procure supplies in April, May, and baseload capacity by September 2025.

dbps-agri-puhunan-forest-program-recognized-for-sustainable-development	DBP's Agri-Puhunan, Forest Program recognized for sustainable development	State-owned Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) has been recognized by an international group of development financial institutions for its programs aimed at advancing financial inclusion in agriculture and restoring forest cover.\nDBP President and Chief Executive Officer Michael O. de Jesus said that the Bank was honored for its Forest Program and its participation in the Department of Agriculture’s Agri-Puhunan at Pantawid (APP) Program during the Association of Development Financing Institutions in Asia and the Pacific (ADFIAP) Awards program held in Muscat, Oman. \nDe Jesus noted that these accolades further inspire the DBP and affirm the Bank’s efforts to help realize President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.’s goals, particularly in the areas of food security, financial inclusion, and environmental protection.\nThe DBP Forest Program (DFP) received a Merit Award under the Corporate Social Responsibility category. \nDe Jesus added that the DFP is the Bank’s CSR program for the environment, with over 50 projects spanning 6,386 hectares across the archipelago. He highlighted ADFIAP's citation of DBP’s Mindanao State University-Buug Forest Project, which involves the rehabilitation of a 100-hectare upland forest in Camp Salman, Tungawan, Zamboanga Sibugay. \nThis project has benefitted erstwhile members of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, with de Jesus stating that it has helped improve the lives of former rebels by offering livelihood opportunities towards achieving peace and economic development in Mindanao.\nThe APP, which was conferred with a Merit Award for Financial Inclusion, is being undertaken in partnership with the Department of Agriculture (DA) and aims to improve rice productivity, ensure food security, and promote agricultural sustainability in the country. \nDe Jesus explained that the APP Program was launched by the DA in 2024 and provides a minimum of P60,000 credit assistance to farmer-beneficiaries through their cooperatives. \nThis financial assistance is credited through an Intervention Monitoring Card (IMC) to finance farming capital expenses and provide cash advances for other labor expenses until the harvesting season. \nAs of December 2024, a total of ₱127-million has been released to cooperatives to support 1,588 farmers working in more than 2,000 hectares of land in Nueva Ecija. DBP and DA are seeking to expand the program to cover 1.3-million hectares in rice-producing provinces.\nDe Jesus assured that DBP will continue to work with its stakeholders in pushing for initiatives that will enhance the country’s resilience against climate change and enabling our countrymen, particularly our farmers, to enjoy greater access to financial tools and increase their productivity.\nDBP is the 10th largest bank in the country in terms of assets and provides credit support to four priority sectors of the economy: infrastructure and logistics; micro, small and medium enterprises; the environment; and social services and community development. \nADFIAP, founded in 1976, serves as the focal point of banks and financial institutions engaged in development financing, with 97 member-institutions in 42 countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Its annual awards program recognizes financial institutions that have contributed significantly to sustainable development practices in their respective countries.

empowered-careers	EmPOWERed Careers	As one of the Philippines’ largest producers and distributors of electric power, Aboitiz Power Corporation (AboitizPower) carries out its purpose of Transforming Energy for a Better World through its corporate values of integrity, teamwork, innovation, responsibility, and service excellence.\nAt the root of it all are people who live out these values, and among the values’ exemplars are Aboitiz Scholars who eventually joined AboitizPower. Jey De Los Reyes, Jarren De Guzman, Jon Kristoffer Tagalog, and Vince Jane “Vinchay” Olaer — once bright students who are now dedicated team members.\nEven way back then, these Aboitiz Scholars already understood that the grant — and what it represents — was not just support, but also added motivation.\nJey De Los Reyes of Visayan Electric (left) took up BS Electrical Engineering, while Jarren De Guzman of AP Renewables (right) studied BS Mechanical Engineering, both with the help of an Aboitiz Scholarship. Today, they enjoy promising careers in AboitizPower — one in power distribution, the other in clean energy generation — while adhering to the time-tested\n“The scholarship lifted a huge burden off my shoulders and allowed me to focus on my studies without constantly worrying about expenses. But beyond that, it also gave me a strong sense of purpose and accountability,” recounted Jey.\n“Knowing that I was entrusted with such support motivated me to stay focused and do my best in school, not just for myself, but also to be worthy of the opportunity I was given,” he added. “It shaped the way I approached both my education and my future career — with gratitude, determination, and a mindset to give back.”\nToday, Jey works as Risk and Organizational Performance Manager in Visayan Electric, an AboitizPower subsidiary and the Philippines’ second largest private distribution utility.\n“The sense of responsibility and accountability I developed during my time as an Aboitiz Scholar has been incredibly valuable. Knowing that the company supported me in such a comprehensive way really motivated me to stay focused, not just in my studies but up until now, in every opportunity I’ve had here,” Jey said. “That drive to do my best has carried over into my work, where I take full ownership of my tasks and always strive to exceed expectations.”\nSince joining Visayan Electric, Jey maintained that his career has been greatly shaped by AboitizPower’s values and culture, specifically citing his exposure as part of the engineering corps for further broadening his knowledge and experience, while also being equipped with the skills “needed to tackle challenges and seize new opportunities.”\nLike Jey, Jarren also recognized the weight of responsibility thrust upon himself and his fellow Aboitiz Scholars.\n“The biggest impact that the scholarship had on me was the value of responsibility. Having the opportunity to be an Aboitiz Scholar wasn’t just financial support; it was a commitment. It taught me that I wasn’t only accountable to myself, but also to the people who believed in my potential,” Jarren shared.\n“That pushed me to stay focused, strive for excellence, and give back in whatever way I could,” he added. “I became more intentional with my goals, knowing that what I do reflects not just on me but on the values the scholarship upholds.”\nAfter graduation, Jarren dreamt of working for AboitizPower, saying he was inspired by how the company “prioritizes skill development and capability building”, which he believes “creates an environment where growth is encouraged and supported.”\nFortunately, Jarren eventually began his AboitizPower journey as a Cadet Engineer in Operations and Maintenance. Today, after distinguishing himself amidst various competitions on innovation, he has become a Business Process and Innovation Supervisor for AP Renewables, Inc. or APRI, which is the company’s geothermal power arm located in Tiwi, Albay and in Laguna and Batangas.\n“Looking ahead, the values continue to guide my career choices and fuels my drive to contribute meaningfully, especially in roles where I can create impact beyond myself,” he observed.\nMeanwhile, down south, fellow Aboitiz Scholars-turned-team members also recounted how the scholarship helped them cultivate integrity, teamwork, innovation, responsibility, and service excellence, and how it manifests today in their respective roles.\nAboitiz Scholars Jon Kristoffer Tagalog (left) and Vince Jane “Vinchay” Olaer (right) both finished a degree in Electrical Engineering before eventually becoming part of the operations of the 300-megawatt Therma South baseload power plant in Davao del Sur. The values of integrity, responsibility, and teamwork have guided them since their college days up to today.\n“As the eldest child among nine siblings, it has always been my drive to study hard in order to graduate and look for a job that can help my family financially,” shared Jon. “But being an Aboitiz Scholar, I was already able to help my parents with their financial burden, even while studying.”\n“Bringing the name of Aboitiz, it pushed my drive to another level. I needed people to see that Aboitiz Scholars are achievers in all aspects,” he further explained. “I became a student leader and joined a club that tutors younger students with difficult subjects for free.”\nTo Jon, it was the values of integrity and responsibility, together with keen attention to detail, that brought him to where he is now: a Quality Assurance and Quality Control Technician at AboitizPower’s Therma South in Davao del Sur. Pondering on his current role, he maintained that “quality, compliance, and precision are non-negotiable.”\n“As a scholar, I was entrusted with an opportunity that changed my life, and I carried that sense of accountability with me when I joined the company,” he expressed. “I approach every task, big or small, with the mindset that my work reflects not only on me but on the entire team and organization.”\nVince, a colleague of Jon, also aligned and cultivated her personal values with that of AboitizPower’s, from years of being an Aboitiz Scholar and towards achieving a full circle moment in the company.\n“The Aboitiz scholarship allowed me to cover nearly all of my academic expenses without having to ask my parents for help. It also provided invaluable career development opportunities such as an on-the-job training experience in the Therma South power plant during my third year in college,” she recounted, noting how this played a role in her decision to pursue a career in the power industry.\nAs fate would have it, Vince has been with AboitizPower for the last five years, where she currently works as an Electrical Specialist for Therma South.\n“Values such as integrity and teamwork are essential to my role. Integrity ensures that I follow the highest standards of safety and quality, especially when dealing with critical equipment,” she explained. “Teamwork is equally important because maintenance work often involves collaboration with others to troubleshoot and resolve issues to keep the plant running and the lights on.”\n“These values and skills, nurtured during my time as an Aboitiz Scholar and at present, continue to support my contributions to the company’s success, allowing me to excel in my role and help ensure safe and reliable operations.”	"\\tImages/empowered-careers_1.png,Images/empowered-careers_2.png,Images/empowered-careers_3.png"	AboitizPower's scholarship program empowers scholars, fostering responsibility and accountability.  Scholars like Jey and Jarren found success in their careers, contributing meaningfully to the company's goals.  The program cultivates essential values like integrity, teamwork, and innovation in its recipients.  These values continue to guide their career choices and fuel their drive to contribute significantly to AboitizPower.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/14/empowered-careers

bloomberry-soft-launches-new-online-gaming-platform-with-free-viva-movies	Bloomberry soft-launches new online gaming platform with free Viva movies	Bloomberry Resorts Corp., billionaire Enrique K. Razon Jr.’s leisure and gaming business, has soft-launched its new online gaming platform MegaFUNalo, featuring free Viva movies as an added bonus to players.\nThe firm took out full-page ads in major newspapers to announce the soft launch and its free movies feature, although a grand launch is still being slated for next month.\nStrictly for those 21 years old and above, MegaFUNalo has tapped BDO Unibank, Union Bank of the Philippines (UnionBank), Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI), QRPh, Maya, GCash, and GrabPay for its secure payment channels.\nThe site offers games at fairs, slots, casino games such as poker, blackjack, roulette, and baccarat, as well as several arcade games. Free movies include action, comedy, drama, fantasy, romance, thrillers, and even Koreanovelas.\n"With free games and a movie section, Bloomberry offers some unique features that other platforms don’t. Other platforms feel repetitive. It is basically the same games under different operators. I would say, Bloomberry has a different concept among its peers. There are different layers in the app," said Unicapital Securities Research Analyst Jeri R. Alfonso.\nAbacus Securities Corp. said Bloomberry confirmed it will spend heavily, in the order of at least ₱1 billion to ₱2 billion per quarter, just on advertising and promotions to help the online business get some traction.\nAlfonso said Bloomberry has already reported higher operating expenses tied to its gaming app launch and “we think Travellers (Alliance Global Group Inc. subsidiary Travellers International Hotel Group Inc.) is likely to follow the same cost trend as it gears up to go online.\n"The bulk of these costs will come from customer acquisition efforts, with both companies aiming to close the gap with market leaders. Development-related expenses, especially for outsourced services, are also set to climb."\n\nAlfonso said, "It will take time for Bloomberry to catch up to Digiplus Interactive Corp. in terms of market share. Digiplus Interactive spent three years building its user base—from 800,000 monthly active users (MAUs) in 2022 to 7.5 million by the first quarter of 2025.\n"On top of that, more players are entering the space. Travellers and Hann Holdings Inc. are also launching their own online gaming platforms, so it’s going to get crowded. If Bloomberry wants to stand out, they need to offer bigger jackpots—or at least match Digiplus—to draw users in."\nAbacus said Bloomberry’s management has revealed that they have a third-party provider, for the mobile app being developed, who will then be entitled to a revenue-sharing scheme which wasn't specified.\n“While this mitigates the risk, Bloomberry won't fully enjoy the benefit if/when online does become profitable. In the near to medium term, the losses from this venture will likely be substantial and will probably drag into next year before it starts to contribute positively to the bottom line,” it said.\nMeanwhile, Abacus pointed out that, “Digiplus' spectacular rise and booming profits may have given the impression that it's all easy money and that Bloomberry can just waltz in and join the party.”\n“Truth is, Digiplus has had to spend more and more to acquire active users. Last year, the company spent three times as much as it did on advertising and promotion (A&P) and it still actually lost a few percentage points of market share in terms of gross gaming revenue (GGR),” the brokerage said.

gokongwei-airline-sees-airport-privatization-as-catalyst-for-growth	Gokongwei airline sees airport privatization as catalyst for growth	The Marcos administration’s ongoing campaign to privatize regional airports in the country is supported by Gokongwei-led Cebu Pacific, which emphasized that airport improvements would further strengthen the airline’s initiative to expand capacity.\nCebu Pacific aims to grow its passenger volume this year by 15 to 20 percent, following an all-time high of 24.5 million passengers in 2024.\nThe airline is optimistic about achieving this significant growth through regional airports, from which it has developed various hubs last year to increase passenger capacity.\nThis goal is even more feasible as the government continues to roll out its intensified efforts to privatize several local airports.\n“The important part with the regional airports is to see the continued development. We’re quite encouraged that the government is intending to privatize more airports,” said Cebu Pacific President and Chief Commercial Officer Xander Lao.\nLao said the government’s move to privatize airports benefits airlines such as Cebu Pacific in expanding capacity and planning better.\n“We are excited about all of the privatization initiatives coming along, and we're looking to support that further as it allows us to expand our ops even further,” he noted.\nIn a television interview last week, Transportation Secretary Vince Dizon answered in the affirmative when asked if the privatization effort is a “legacy” of the Marcos administration.\nDizon said the administration has privatized more airports than any other previous leadership, with three airports shifting ownership from the government to the private sector.\nIn September of last year, the San Miguel Corp.-led consortium, New NAIA Infra Corp., took over the operations of the country’s main gateway, Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA).\nLast month, Aboitiz InfraCapital Inc. officially took the reins of Laguindingan International Airport in Misamis Oriental.\nThe company is set to take over Bohol-Panglao International Airport next month.\n“Ang sabi ng Pangulo, we need to privatize as many airports as we can (The President said we need to privatize as many airports as we can),” said Dizon.\nThe transport chief said the government is eyeing to privatize at least six more regional airports.\nWith the expected improvements, Lao said these airports should have the infrastructure ready to carry bigger jets to attract more passengers across a number of tourist destinations.\nAt the present, majority of regional airports in the country have short runways, limiting the aircraft to the much smaller turboprop operations.\n“Obviously because of the development of regional airports in the Philippines, we hope that some of the infrastructure outside Manila can now take jets,” said Lao.\n“So that's something we've expressed to the government and we're encouraged to see that the regional development continues,” he added.

The airline expects infrastructure improvements to allow larger jets, boosting capacity and attracting more tourists.  The government plans to privatize at least six more airports,  a move seen as beneficial for airline expansion and better planning. This initiative is considered a legacy of the Marcos administration.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/02/gokongwei-airline-sees-airport-privatization-as-catalyst-for-growth

adb-to-invest-15-billion-in-clearinghouse-facility-to-boost-rice-farming-across-asia-pacific-including-philippines	ADB to invest $1.5 billion in clearinghouse facility to boost rice farming across Asia-Pacific, including Philippines	The Manila-based Asian Development Bank (ADB) will invest $1.5 billion, or about ₱83.8 billion, through a five-year farming program aiming to improve rice productivity and low-carbon rice production across Asia and the Pacific (APAC), including the Philippines.\nThis is part of the multilateral lender’s broader $40-billion commitment to food systems transformation by 2030, which was announced last month.\nIn particular, a new clearinghouse facility has been set up to promote climate-resilient and high-yield farming methods, efficient water use, inclusive agricultural value chains, and better nutrition for the poorest communities in the region.\nAccording to the ADB, the initiative forged with Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) was launched on Monday, June 9. This will be co-financed by Gates Foundation, the American private foundation founded by Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates in 2000.\n“Rice farming faces mounting pressure, from declining productivity and shrinking water supplies to its significant contribution to greenhouse gas emissions,” the ADB said.\n“Left unaddressed, these challenges threaten food security and the well-being of the poorest and most vulnerable communities,” it added.\nAs such, the project is said to “boost investments in sustainable and low-carbon rice production with the aim of improving the lives of millions of vulnerable smallholder farmers” across the APAC region, the ADB said.\nFatima Yasmin, ADB vice-president for sectors and themes, reported that rice supplies “over a quarter of the region’s calorie intake, and half in Southeast Asia.”\n“Today, that livelihood is increasingly threatened by extreme weather and environmental degradation,” she said.\nYvonne Pinto, director general of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), said this joint initiative “will reinforce CGIAR’s strategic collaboration with the ADB and scale up CGIAR’s innovations in rice systems.”\nLos Baños, Laguna-headquartered IRRI, part of CGIAR’s network of research centers, said that with partners like the ADB and Gates Foundation, it aims to help make Asia’s rice sector more sustainable and resilient—improving the livelihoods of millions of smallholder farmers now and in the years to come.\nThe first set of projects under the initiative is being rolled out in the Philippines, China, Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Pakistan.

50-bps-of-bsp-interest-rate-cuts-coming-before-q3-2025-ends-dbs	50 bps of BSP interest rate cuts coming before Q3 2025 ends—DBS	Singapore's DBS Bank Ltd. expects the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) to end its easing cycle in the third quarter of this year—a year after it began loosening monetary policy in August last year.\n"The Philippine central bank, the BSP, is on course with its rate cuts. Another 50-basis point (bp) cut is likely, bringing the benchmark overnight repo rate to its terminal level of five percent by the end of the third quarter of 2025," from the current 5.5 percent, DBS Group Research senior rates strategist Eugene Leow and rates strategist and economist Samuel Tse said in a June 9 report.\nThe Monetary Board (MB), the BSP's highest policy-making body, will next decide on the monetary policy stance on June 19. After this month's anticipated rate cut of at least 25 bps, the MB's next interest rate decision will be on Aug. 28—the only meeting within the third quarter.\nThe last two MB meetings on monetary policy for 2025 will be in the fourth quarter, on Oct. 9 and Dec. 11.\n"Including the previous 100 bps in cuts, the BSP will have reduced the policy rate by a total of 200 bps since mid-2024," DBS noted.\nFor DBS, "rapidly decelerating CPI [consumer price index] inflation, which fell from 8.7 percent in early 2023 to 1.4 percent in April 2025, allows further rate cuts."\nThe government reported last week that headline inflation in May fell to 1.3 percent, bringing the first five-month average to 1.9 percent—below the targeted two- to four-percent range of annual price increases deemed manageable and conducive to economic growth.\nThe Singaporean bank believes that lower interest rates would help shield the Philippine economy from external shocks, mainly coming from United States (US) tariffs.\n"While previous reciprocal tariffs on the Philippines were relatively low at 17 percent, a potential trade war renewal poses risks to the external sector," DBS said, citing that Philippine exports to the US cornered more than 15 percent of total last year.\nAs such, "potential spillover effects on the domestic economy and labor market warrant concern," it said.\nDBS said that "at this juncture, the real interest rate remains restrictive at 4.1 percent."\nIn this regard, DBS forecasts short-end Philippine government bond yields to "see more notable downward pressure, and the spread against US Treasury yields should compress."

This follows a decline in inflation from 8.7% in early 2023 to 1.4% in April 2025. Lower rates aim to protect the Philippine economy from external shocks, particularly potential US tariffs impacting exports.

bsp-consumer-complaints-jump-62-in-2024-mediation-success-rate-improves	BSP consumer complaints jump 62% in 2024; mediation success rate improves	Consumer complaints filed with the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) surged by 62.3 percent in 2024 to around 70,000 cases, according to officials of the central bank.\nOf the total number of consumer complaints, 13 percent were categorized as unauthorized transactions, Charina B. De Vera-Yap, managing director of the BSP’s financial inclusion and consumer empowerment sub-sector, said during a press briefing on the Anti-Financial Account Scamming Act (AFASA) on Wednesday, June 11. \nReports last year showed that the central bank processed over 43,000 complaints, which was also 95-percent higher than 2022’s over 22,000 cases.\nThese were recorded through various channels of the BSP’s consumer assistance mechanism (CAM).\n“But those are the complaints elevated up to the BSP because the first level of recourse if ever you are making a complaint is your financial institution,” De Vera-Yap noted.\nThe number of cases elevated to the central bank for mediation more than doubled to 703 in 2024 from 322 in the previous year, and the success rate also improved to 83 percent in 2024 from 69 percent in 2023, according to Janice G. Ayson-Zales, director at the BSP’s consumer complaints resolution office.\nAbout 41 percent of complaints were resolved in favor of the complainants.\nAs of May this year, the resolution office already handled 400 mediation cases, indicating a continued growth in the volume of such cases.\n“With the passage of the AFASA, we are anticipating that complaints will go down because for example if the banks are able to implement the FMS, the fraud management system…in case there are behavioral anomalies, the bank will stop the transaction,” De Vera-Yap further said.\nDe Vera-Yap said figures on consumer complaints specific to AFASA could be available by the end of the year or in 2026.\nUnder the Financial Products and Services Consumer Protection Act (FCPA), BSP-supervised financial institutions are required to set up their own systems to handle consumer complaints and inquiries.

bpi-remains-committed-to-re-financing-despite-quiet-pullout-of-foreign-investors	BPI remains committed to RE financing, despite 'quiet' pullout of foreign investors	Ayala-led Bank of the Philippine Islands' (BPI) supporting inclusion, nature, and growth (SINAG) bonds now hold the record as the largest peso bond issuance to date.\nIn a listing ceremony on Tuesday, June 10, BPI SINAG bonds were officially listed on the Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corp. (PDEx) with a total principal amount of ₱40 billion. The bonds are structured with a 1.5-year tenor and carry an interest rate of 5.8 percent per annum that would be paid quarterly.\nAccording to BPI, the proceeds would be utilized to finance or refinance eligible green and social projects as part of its sustainable funding framework.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDino Gasmen, BPI’s treasurer and head of global markets, explained that this move would further push sustainability in projects, as he said that, “The enthusiastic response to the BPI SINAG bonds reflects a growing alignment between capital markets and sustainability. We are honored by the trust placed in us and excited to channel these funds into projects that directly benefit communities and the environment.”\nMoreover, the issuance would highlight BPI’s commitment in mobilizing capital toward long-term resilience and value creation.\nIn an ambush interview, Gasmen further explained that proceeds from SINAG bonds are partly to exercise refinancing activities.\n“For this one, the SINAG bond, we saw that the demand from our clients and customers was really huge. I think it's partly because of the awareness that it's a sustainability bond,” he told reporters.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“We could have issued at least ₱20 billion more. But we also had to weigh it against what we can promise to you. Because we don't want to borrow for sustainability purposes then we can't deploy. [It's like] we just took advantage of the feature of the bond and then not fulfilling our end of the bargain. So, we came up with an amount that is a bit challenging for the bank to accomplish,” Gasmen added.\nMoreover, when asked for if there will be more bond issuances this year, the BPI treasurer explained that this would depend on various factors such as market conditions.\n“I’m not yet sure, this is one big maturity for us that we’ve been able to refinance. The rest depends on how the market goes. If the loans are strong, if the economy is strong, which means most likely demand for loans will also be strong, then we just might,” he said, noting a bond issuance that may happen in January 2026.\nOn financing RE\nAmid concerns that some foreign renewable energy (RE) investors are “quietly” pulling out of their commitments to the Philippines, BPI reaffirmed its strong commitment to supporting green energy projects.\nCiting some examples globally, such as the strong RE presence in Europe and the pullback of certain green energy projects in United States (US), Gasmen assured that local banks will continue to support sustainable assets.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“In the Philippines, I think the issue is the assets. It’s hard to find the assets… [So], I think the banks are willing. They want more sustainability assets. They have their own sustainability programs,” he said.\n“With regard to BPI, no, we’re not pulling back at all. I think this sustainability initiative is very important to us… We’re celebrating sustainability awareness month [this June].”\nFurthermore, BPI shared that the bank is on track to reduce its financing of coal power generation by half in 2026, and to zero by 2032.	"\\tImages/bpi-remains-committed-to-renewable-energy-financing-despite-quiet-pullout-of-foreign-investors_1.png"	BPI's ₱40 billion SINAG bond issuance is the largest peso bond to date, financing green and social projects.  The bond's success reflects growing market alignment with sustainability.  Despite some foreign investors pulling out, BPI remains strongly committed to RE financing. BPI aims to halve coal financing by 2026 and eliminate it by 2032.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/10/bpi-remains-committed-to-renewable-energy-financing-despite-quiet-pullout-of-foreign-investors
banks-to-shoulder-fraud-losses-if-fms-falls-short-bsp	Banks to shoulder fraud losses if FMS falls short—BSP	Banks and other financial institutions may be held liable for fraud suffered by their clients if they fail to implement fraud management systems (FMS) within the mandated one-year transition period, a top official at the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) said.\nBSP Deputy Governor Elmore O. Capule told reporters on the sidelines of the Anti-Financial Account Scamming Act (AFASA) press briefing on Wednesday, June 11, that financial institutions may face serious consequences if they fail to comply with the new law.\nFirst, they may face administrative sanctions. Second, “if somebody gets defrauded and their system is not ready, they can be held once civilly liable. So instead of going after the scammer, the institution will have to pay,” Capule said.\n“If you fail to comply with the fraud management system, then you can be held civilly liable for the damage caused to the victim,” Capule asserted, adding that the likelihood of falling victim to frauds could be lesser if financial institutions had already built FMS.\nCapule said that if the system is in place, fraud could be prevented. But in cases where banks still do not run the system, they may be held responsible for the losses.\n“So it’s [FMS] a very big deterrent. I hope, in one year’s time, they should comply,” Capule said.\nUnder the AFASA, the BSP requires all financial institutions with complex electronic products and services (EPS) and those with a high aggregate value of digital transactions—initially set at ₱75 million per month—to implement a more sophisticated FMS.\nMaricris A. Salud, deputy director at the BSP’s technology risk and innovation supervision department, noted that commercial banks or big banks are on track to fully comply with the mandate.\n“It’s actually the smaller institutions who are asking for the transitory provision,” Salud further said.\nCapule said that while one-time password (OTP)-based multi-factor authentication was once state-of-the-art, evolving threats now require more advanced and supplemental security measures, as outlined in Circular 1213, prompting the adoption of additional FMS.\n“Sometimes, a good system is only good until the scammers find a way to go around it,” Capule said.\nAs such, Capule said that the central bank is “recommending financial institutions to look for other alternative measures including multi-factor authentication [MFA].” This is on top of OTPs which is a widespread mode of authentication.\nAmong the recommended MFA methods are biometrics—such as fingerprint, facial, and voice recognition—and behavioral tools that analyze user patterns like typing speed and device movements to verify identity.\nPasswordless authentication methods, including biometrics, hardware tokens, and cryptographic keys, such as Fast Identity Online (FIDO), which enable users to log in using biological features or a security device instead of a password, are also permitted.	"\\tImages/banks-to-shoulder-fraud-losses-if-fms-falls-shortbsp_1.png"	Philippine banks face liability for client fraud losses if they don't implement mandated fraud management systems (FMS) within a year.  Failure to comply results in civil liability for damages, with the institution paying victims instead of pursuing scammers.  Smaller institutions are seeking a transitional period, while larger banks are on track to meet the requirements.  The BSP recommends additional security measures beyond OTPs, including multi-factor authentication (MFA) using biometrics and behavioral analysis.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/12/banks-to-shoulder-fraud-losses-if-fms-falls-shortbsp
amid-political-instability-foreign-direct-investments-drop-to-three-month-low-in-march	Amid political 'instability,' foreign direct investments drop to three-month low in March	Net inflows of brick-and-mortar foreign direct investment (FDI) into the Philippines fell to $498 million in March, the lowest in three months, as heightened political instability and lingering United States (US) tariff-led uncertainty eroded investor confidence.\nNet FDI inflows amounted to $498 million in March, declining by 27.8 percent from $689 million in the same month last year, according to the latest data from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP).\nIt showed that FDI net inflows in March were the lowest since December last year, when they reached only $110 million.\nAs observed, the total value in March continued the year-to-date downward trend. The March figure dropped by 5.9 percent from February’s $529 million, which had already declined by 27.6 percent from January’s $731 million.\nThe BSP said in a statement released on Tuesday, June 10, that the decline seen at the end of the first quarter was mainly due to the “lower net inflows across all major FDI components.”\nNonresidents’ net investments in debt instruments dropped by 31.6 percent year-on-year to $329 million in March, down from $481 million a year earlier.\nAlso, nonresidents’ net investments in equity capital (excluding reinvested earnings) declined by 27.4 percent to $102 million from $141 million, while reinvestment of earnings slipped by 1.2 percent to $66 million from $67 million.\nThe top five primary sources of equity capital placements during the month were Singapore (25 percent), Japan (24 percent), the US (20 percent), South Korea (nine percent), and Malaysia (five percent).\nMost of these investments went towards industries including real estate (37 percent), manufacturing (33 percent), financial and insurance (nine percent), and administrative and support services (seven percent).\nFDI net inflows for the first three months also declined by 41.1 percent to $1.8 billion from the $3 billion recorded in the same period a year ago.\nFDI refers to cross-border investments where a nonresident investor owns at least 10-percent equity in a local enterprise, and may take the form of equity capital, reinvested earnings, or intercompany borrowings.\nThe Philippines is eyeing to attract $10 billion in FDI this year, higher than last year’s $8.93 billion.\nJohn Paolo Rivera, senior research fellow at state-run policy think tank Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS), said the continued decline in FDI net inflows could be attributed to both foreign and domestic developments.\nRizal Commercial Banking Corp. (RCBC) chief economist Michael Ricafort also said local political noise was a factor.\n“While global trade headwinds such as the US tariff actions weigh on investor confidence broadly, domestic political noise adds another layer of uncertainty that can significantly affect foreign investor sentiment,” Rivera said.\nRivera noted that political instability, which he referred to as leadership transitions, “especially when accompanied by talks of reshuffles, shifts in policy direction, or governance issues may raise concerns about policy continuity, regulatory risks, and the overall business environment.”\n“Even the perception of instability or unpredictability can prompt investors to adopt a wait-and-see stance, delaying or even diverting capital elsewhere in the region,” he argued.\nHe added that political noise can raise the risk premium investors place on the country, especially when compared to neighboring Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) economies seen as “more stable or consistent in policy implementation.”\nAs such, Rivera said political noise should be managed “carefully to ensure investor confidence is maintained amid already challenging global conditions.”	"\\tImages/amid-political-instability-foreign-direct-investments-drop-to-three-month-low-in-march_1.png"	March saw foreign direct investment (FDI) in the Philippines drop to a three-month low of $498 million, a 27.8 percent decline year-on-year.  This decrease is attributed to political instability and US tariff uncertainties impacting investor confidence.  The decline continues a year-to-date downward trend, with March's figure down 5.9 percent from February's $529 million.  Experts point to political noise and leadership transitions as factors eroding investor sentiment.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/10/amid-political-instability-foreign-direct-investments-drop-to-three-month-low-in-march
business-group-hails-passage-of-99-year-foreign-lease-right-of-way-bills	Business group hails passage of 99-year foreign lease, right-of-way bills	The Federation of Filipino Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry Inc. (FFCCCII) lauded Congress for approving economic reform bills that seek to extend the term of foreign leases to 99 years and streamline the rigorous right-of-way process.\nFFCCCII, which comprises over 170 business and trade associations, said the two bills will help spur more foreign investments into the country and fast-track infrastructure projects that are a boon for the economy.\n“These landmark legislative measures mark a decisive step forward in enhancing the Philippines’ economic dynamism, global competitiveness, and attractiveness as a prime investment destination,” the group said in a statement, signed by its president, Victor Lim.\nBoth the Senate and the House of Representatives earlier approved the bicameral conference committee reports embodying the reconciled versions of the two bills.\nThe two bills are identified as priority measures of the Marcos administration under the Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council (LEDAC).\nWith their approval in both chambers of Congress, the final step is the president’s signature, which makes them law.\nFFCCCII said the business community has long advocated for these measures given their transformative potential in unlocking new economic opportunities for the country.\nThe proposed 99-year lease bill, according to the group, will provide “much-needed stability and confidence” for investors looking to expand in the Philippines.\nThe bill seeks to extend the foreign leases in the country to 99 years from the current 75, aligning the Philippines with Singapore (99-year lease), Malaysia (99 years), and Indonesia (95 years).\nFFCCCII earlier said that a 99-year lease would signal long-term security for investors, further attracting billion-dollar business ventures to invest in the country.\n“This bill is a pledge to future generations: the Philippines can claim its place as Asia’s next growth titan. By embracing the reform of 99-year leases, we harness foreign capital for national progress while safeguarding our patrimony,” it said.\nMeanwhile, the proposed Accelerated and Reformed Right-of-Way Act aims to expedite infrastructure projects that have long been plagued by issues related to right-of-way acquisitions.\nBy mitigating bureaucratic delays, FFCCCII stated that this bill will ensure the timely execution of projects aimed at enhancing transportation in the country.\nIn a previous statement, the group said introducing standardized valuation based on fair market principles, guaranteed funding for land acquisition, and structured resettlement programs are essential reforms to “break the cycle of failure” in the country’s infrastructure system.\n“A modern ROW law ensures both fairness and efficiency—delivering prompt, just compensation while unlocking projects that will benefit generations,” it said.\nWith the near approval of the two measures, FFCCCII is calling for sustained focus on meaningful socio-economic reforms that promote inclusive prosperity, enhance ease of doing business, and improve the country’s position in global trade and investment networks.\n“We encourage greater emphasis on trade, investments, and tourism promotion within the country’s diplomatic and political discourse, ensuring that economic diplomacy remains a cornerstone of our international engagements,” it added.

The resignation letters must be addressed to the President.\nSimilar to the Cabinet secretaries, the acceptance, reassignment, or replacement of GOCC heads’ resignations falls under the prerogative of the President. This could mean some agency heads might be retained or removed from their offices.\n\nDepartment of Finance (DOF) Secretary Ralph G. Recto, who was retained in his post, has yet to release a statement on whether GOCCs are vulnerable to disruption from abrupt leadership changes, or if such changes could affect the continuity of revenue generation within the agencies.

SLF measures the percentage of available seats that are occupied.\nCebu Pacific Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Mike Szucs said SLF is tracking ahead of last year as additional capacity continues to be absorbed by demand.\nThe airline’s domestic passengers rose nearly 20 percent to 1.83 million, compared to last year’s 1.53 million. The SLF of this segment reached 91 percent.\nMeanwhile, international passengers soared to 602,000, a 28-percent hike from the prior year’s 472,000. This unit saw SLF surge to 75 percent.\nFor the first five months of the year, Cebu Pacific's passenger volume grew to 11.7 million, a 24 percent jump from 9.4 million in the same period last year.\nAs of end-May, domestic passengers increased 23 percent to 8.69 million from the previously recorded 7.04 million.\nInternational traffic likewise went up nearly 25 percent from 2.40 million to three million.\nDuring the period, SLF averaged 85 percent, while overall seat capacity grew 23 percent to 13.7 million.\n"Passenger traffic continued to see high year-on-year growth through the first five months of 2025," said Szucs.\n"We remain focused on aligning capacity to meet the demand while continuing to manage the engine and supply chain challenges affecting the industry," he added.\nSzucs earlier said that the carrier is targeting a 15 to 20 percent growth in passenger volume this year.\nIn 2024, Cebu Pacific carried an all-time high of 24.5 million passengers, up 17 percent from 20.9 million in 2023.\nLast month, Cebu Pacific signed a wet-lease agreement with Saudi Arabia-based budget carrier to lease out two of its Airbus A320 aircraft during the peak flying season in the Middle East.\nReciprocally, the Filipino airline is examining the prospect of wet-leasing A320s from Flyadeal during the winter period in Southeast Asia.\nThrough the agreement, alongside the plan to increase its fleet to 100 aircraft, Cebu Pacific is eyeing to operate at strong capacity year-round.\nCebu Pacific operates in 37 domestic and 26 international destinations.

I-implement na natin sa MRT at sa ibang mga tren natin,” said Dizon.\n(This is around July, if I’m not mistaken. We will already implement it on the MRT and on our other trains.)\n“Alam ko pati credit card puwede na. Ita-tap mo na lang ‘yung phone mo. Hindi ka na kailangan bumili ng Beep card,“ he added.\n(I know credit cards can also be used now. You’ll just tap your phone. You no longer need to buy a Beep card.)\nPresident Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. earlier ordered the DOTr to develop an open-loop payment system that is integrated with multiple financial platforms.\nMarcos said such a system is inspired by the inclusive systems employed by leading transit networks nationwide.\n“Nakikita na naman natin ito sa ibang bansa. So, iyon ang sabi ng ating Pangulo, gawin na rin natin ‘yung mga modern facilities sa ibang bansa dito para sa mga kababayan natin,” said Dizon.\n(We’re seeing this again in other countries. So, as our President said, let’s also build here the modern facilities that they have abroad for the benefit of our fellow citizens.)\nThe DOTr is now working with transport operators and financial service providers to ensure a smooth rollout of the cashless turnstiles.\nThe pilot testing and public information campaigns for the new payment scheme are planned for the period leading up to the July launch.

nlex-operator-willing-to-build-new-marilao-bridge	NLEX operator willing to build new Marilao bridge	The private operator of North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) said it is willing to build a “new and upgraded” Marilao Interchange Bridge after it was once again struck by an overheight truck, prompting the government’s ire.\nIn a statement late Friday, June 20, NLEX Corp. said it has been expediting repair work on the damaged bridge to alleviate traffic congestion at the northbound segment of the expressway in Marilao, Bulacan.\nThe company was earlier ordered by the Department of Transportation (DOTr) to submit a written explanation to justify why it should not face sanctions over the repeated crashes at the structure.\nIt was likewise ordered to suspend toll collection and submit a safety improvement plan.\nNLEX Corp., in response, emphasized that the Marilao Interchange Bridge is not under its supervision but rather the provincial government of Bulacan as part of its road network.\n“The bridge was constructed prior to the rehabilitation of the NLEX and presently has a vertical clearance of 4.27 meters at both directions,” the company said.\n“It is not part of the NLEX Concession; nonetheless, NLEX conducts necessary repairs on the bridge to ensure its structural integrity for the safety of the NLEX motorists,” it added.\nAccording to NLEX Corp., it has “actively sought” support from the government for the structural upgrading of the bridge; yet, the structure remained unchanged.\n“In the interest of public safety, NLEX offers to construct a new and upgraded bridge to support the plans of the relevant national and local government agencies,” it said.\nOn Wednesday, an overheight 18-wheeler trailer truck struck the Marilao Interchange Bridge. The impact of which detached one of the bridge’s girders which fell onto an incoming Asian utility vehicle (AUV), killing one person and injuring several others.\nNLEX Corp. said they are in full cooperation with the DOTr, the Toll Regulatory Board (TRB) and the Philippine National Police (PNP) in the investigation of the incident.\n“We are truly saddened by this incident, and our hearts go out to all those affected and their families during this difficult time. We commit our support and assistance as they navigate through this challenging situation,” it said.\nThe company said it has implemented measures after the incident to ensure enforcement against vehicles which violates height limits.\nIn March, a truck that exceeded its vertical clearance also crashed into the bridge, which resulted in a week-long heavy traffic due to the succeeding repair work. During this period, NLEX Corp. waived fees.

bpi-downgrades-psei-target-as-sentiment-weighed-down-by-us-tariff-issue-weaker-gdp	BPI downgrades PSEi target as sentiment weighed down by US tariff issue, weaker GDP	BPI Securities Corp. has downgraded its year-end target for the benchmark Philippine Stock Exchange index (PSEi) by 300 points or four percent to 7,300 due to the impact of United States (US) President Donald Trump’s unstable tariff policy on global markets, although the brokerage is more optimistic of prospects in 2026.\n“The PSEi closed at 6,341 as of end-May, a nine-percent recovery from its low last April 7 but is still down three percent year-to-date. Global economic uncertainties arising from US tariff measures continue to weigh on investor confidence,” BPI Securities said.\nThe tariff issue continues to affect the PSEi even though private domestic consumption, rather than exports, has been the traditional growth driver of the Philippine economy.\nIn the first quarter of 2025, consumption accounted for 78 percent of nominal gross domestic product (GDP) while exports were at 17 percent.\n“The ultimate export exposure to the US is relatively limited at about three percent of Philippine GDP. This helps against the impact of rising US trade protectionism, in our view,” the brokerage said.\nIt added that, “The local market also faced an uphill climb following weaker-than-expected first-quarter 2025 GDP results and a lackluster corporate earnings season.”\nBecause of this, the brokerage said, “We see the PSEi settling at 7,300 (from 7,600) by end-2025, implying about 15-percent upside and a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 11.6 times—below the 10-year average of 17 times and still near Covid-levels.”\n“Factors supportive of a market valuation re-rating are resilient corporate earnings, waning domestic inflation, and further rate cuts,” it added.\nEstimated core earnings growth of the PSEi in the first quarter of 2025 is at 6.5 percent year-on-year. There were pockets of weakness, however, from specific sectors such as consumer, conglomerates, and telecommunications.\n“Following earnings estimates revisions, we forecast core earnings growth of the PSEi to trend at 7.9 percent (from 10 percent) this year.\n“We are more upbeat towards 2026, especially for cyclical sectors (i.e., consumer, property, and conglomerates), amid a benign inflation outlook and looser monetary policy environment,” BPI Securities said.\nIt noted that, subdued inflation expectations amid lower global rice and crude oil prices should provide relief to consumers while, with the recent weakness of the US dollar, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas’ (BSP) policy easing cycle is seen to continue, amid expectations of three rate cuts this year.\n“The accommodative monetary set-up is good news for the market as lower borrowing costs prompt higher consumer and business spending, and is also a major tailwind to corporate valuations,” BPI Securities said.\nThe brokerage said that potential headwinds include knock-on effects of supply shocks due to trade war escalation and risk of lesser US Fed rate cuts and its impact to the BSP’s rate-cutting cycle.\nIt is also concerned about potential US measures on reshoring jobs and stricter immigration enforcement that could impact overseas Filipino workers’ (OFWs) remittances and business process outsourcing (BPO) revenues.

However, BPI is more optimistic for 2026, citing resilient corporate earnings and lower inflation.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/12/bpi-downgrades-psei-target-as-sentiment-weighed-down-by-us-tariff-issue-weaker-gdp
bsp-easing-cycle-far-from-over-as-peso-remains-stronger-inflation-softering-ing	BSP easing cycle 'far from over' as peso remains stronger, inflation softer—ING	Netherlands-based financial giant ING does not expect the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) to end its easing cycle in the upcoming monetary policy meeting, citing below-target inflation and a continued appreciation of the peso.\nThese factors, coupled with “high real rates, and uncertainty over global growth, reinforce our view that monetary policy easing is far from over,” Deepali Bhargava, head of research at ING Asia-Pacific, said in the bank’s week-ahead report published Friday, June 13.\nThe Monetary Board (MB), the BSP’s top policy-making body, will determine the next monetary policy stance on June 19, Thursday next week.\nFollowing an expected extension of interest rate cuts by a quarter point this month, the MB’s next monetary policy decision will be on Aug. 28, the only meeting in the third quarter. The two remaining policy meetings for 2025 will be in the fourth quarter, on Oct. 9 and Dec. 11.\nThe latest data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) showed that annual increases in consumer prices dropped to 1.3 percent in May, the lowest inflation rate in five-and-a-half years or since the pre-pandemic period. Notably, the poorest households experienced no increase in overall prices.\nThe May inflation rate fell far below the government’s target band of two to four percent. It was also at the midpoint of the central bank’s forecast range of 0.9 percent to 1.7 percent.\nAccording to ING, the modest inflation reading for May gives room for another 25-basis point (bp) cut by the BSP. If realized, it would bring the key borrowing cost down to 5.25 percent from the current 5.5 percent.\nSince the BSP kicked off its easing cycle in August last year, it has so far slashed a total of 100 bps from a policy rate of 6.5 percent prior to monetary policy loosening.\nIt would take three more quarter-point cuts for the key borrowing rate to settle at the 4.75-percent level, at which the market has been expecting the easing cycle to close this year.\nOver a week ago, MUFG Bank Ltd. projected the peso to sustain its appreciation against the United States (US) dollar until early 2026. According to earlier reports of Manila Bulletin, the Japanese financial giant projected the peso to keep gaining strength, settling at the ₱54 level by year-end though the first quarter of 2026.\nIt cited subdued inflation, the improvement in brick-and-mortar foreign direct investment (FDI), the possibility of a trade deal with the US, and the country’s strong infrastructure spending as supportive of the relatively stronger peso.\nBut the latest report from the BSP showed that net inflows of FDI into the Philippines fell to $498 million in March, the lowest in three months, as heightened political instability and lingering US tariff-led uncertainty eroded investor confidence.	"\\tImages/bsp-easing-cycle-far-from-over-as-peso-remains-stronger-inflation-softering_1.png"	ING expects the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) to continue its easing cycle due to below-target inflation and a stronger peso.  May's inflation rate hit a five-and-a-half year low of 1.3 percent, allowing for another potential 25-basis point cut.  The BSP has already cut rates by 100 basis points since August 2024.

Through this partnership, FinEd Unboxed will be integrated into NTC’s curriculum and community engagement efforts, contributing to the development of financially savvy future educators and community leaders.\n“Our partnership with NTC marks a meaningful stride in advancing our advocacy for financial inclusion,” said Carmina Marquez, BPIF Executive Director.\n“By equipping educators and NTC’s partner communities with essential financial knowledge and tools, we are empowering more Filipinos to make informed financial decisions and fostering lasting change in communities across the country,” Marquez said.\nNTC President Alfredo Antonio I. Ayala emphasized the transformative power of the joint effort.\n“At NTC, we believe that education is the great equalizer. By working with BPI Foundation, we are not only enriching the learning journey of our students but also creating a ripple effect of financial empowerment in our partner communities,” Ayala shared.\nThe partnership is expected to benefit over 11,000 individuals, including students, teaching and non-teaching personnel, and NTC’s adopted communities.\nIn the first months of 2025, BPIF’s FinEd programs have empowered over 300,000 beneficiaries—and the number continues to grow as more activities roll out nationwide in the coming months. This milestone was made possible through a variety of impactful programs, including Train-the-Trainers sessions, as well as FinEd modules delivered in partnership with ASKI Foundation, Inc. for migrant domestic workers, with DSWD for 4Ps beneficiaries, and with Knowledge Channel Foundation, Inc. (KCFI) for students.

20-kilo-rice-now-available-for-minimum-wage-workers	₱20/kilo rice now available for minimum wage workers	Minimum wage earners can now take advantage of the government’s ₱20-per-kilo subsidized rice following its rollout in Manila led by the Department of Agriculture (DA) and the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE).\nAgriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel and Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma joined members of Manila Harbor Center Port Services Inc. (MHCPSI) labor union on Friday, June 13, to launch the program at Manila Harbor Center.\n“This isn’t just about rice—it is about dignity. It is about proving that the government can deliver for the Filipinos who need it most,” said Laurel.\n“We are fulfilling President Marcos’ promise of affordable food—subsidized for now, but ideally self-sustaining in the future through agricultural modernization,” he added.\nState-run Food Terminal Inc. (FTI), which is tasked to procure rice from the National Food Authority (NFA), is planning to spend about ₱5 billion for the entire ₱20 rice program this year.\nWith the inclusion of minimum wage earners, FTI will allocate ₱500 million of the amount to handle additional operations, packaging, and logistics costs.\nLaguesma, in a statement, said expanding the program to include minimum wage workers will help push the administration’s goal of supporting the country’s most vulnerable sectors.\nHe said this will improve the purchasing power of workers, further easing the financial burden of purchasing the staple at higher prices.\nBased on the latest data from the DA, over 16,000 workers have already benefited from the program, which was available in 97 establishments nationwide.\nAt Manila Harbor Center in Tondo, 800 MHCPSI labor union members availed of the ₱20 rice.\nThe government is planning to expand the initiative to up to 500 participating outlets, targeting nearly 120,000 minimum wage earners.\nDubbed as “Benteng Bigas, Meron Na,” the ₱20 rice program was first launched in Cebu on May 1 and was later made available in Kadiwa ng Pangulo (KNP) stores across the country.\nThe cheap rice was initially made available for vulnerable sectors such as indigents, senior citizens, persons with disabilities (PWDs), and members of the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps).\nThe DA said that the ₱20 rice will be available to low- to lower-middle-income families in the near future.\nWith the plan to extend until 2028, the program will potentially benefit up to 15 million households or approximately 60 million Filipinos.

govt-pushes-renewables-for-remote-areas-to-address-diesel-dependence	Gov't pushes renewables for remote areas to address diesel dependence	In a continuing push to improve the power situation in off-grid communities, the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) are collaborating on a program to upgrade the off-grid systems of the National Power Corp. (NPC).\nDuring the Asian Clean Energy Forum (ACEF), Energy Undersecretary Rowena Guevara noted the persistent issue of some remote areas relying heavily on diesel-based power.\n“Off-grid areas, while representing only two percent of national demand, are overwhelmingly powered by imported oil— accounting for 85 percent of generation in these areas,” she said in her keynote speech.\n“To address this, we are working with the [ADB] on a $461 million program to help the [NPC] hybridize off-grid systems and strengthen distribution lines, reducing dependence on imported fuels and lowering power costs,” she added.\nWhile the government and the development bank are partnering to support NPC's hybridization funding, Guevara expressed optimism regarding the country’s renewable energy (RE) initiatives.\n“On the brighter side, [RE] offers a promising pathway forward. RE resources are indigenous, environmentally sustainable, and more resilient against global market shocks… However, the share of variable renewables— solar and wind— is still low, at just over three percent. This means we have significant room for growth,” she said.\nFurthermore, the DOE urged financial institutions to explore more deals that minimize reliance on long-term off-take agreements.\n“This will mitigate stranded asset risks and aligns with our efforts to empower consumers through the Retail Competition and Open Access (RCOA) policy,” Guevara added.\nIn addition, the energy department is working to enhance the financial viability of market platforms, such as the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM).\n“You know, we need to build smart. Since we’re installing electricity, let’s at least make it renewable, not diesel.”\nGEA Updates\nAs renewable investments continue to gain traction, Guevara informed reporters that the DOE is set to announce the winning bidders of the third round of the Green Energy Auction (GEA-3) next week.\n“Hopefully by Monday, but we can’t say [how many bidders],” she mentioned in a brief interview.\nTo recap, GEA-3 involves the auctioning of various green capacities, including 4,000 megawatts (MW) of pumped storage, 300 MW of impounding hydropower, 100 MW of geothermal, and 75 MW of run-of-river hydropower.\nThe bidders were previously announced last January.\nWith GEA-5 anticipated to commence in the third quarter of 2025, Guevara shared that they are awaiting the go-ahead to publish the necessary bidding information.\nGEA-5 is dedicated to offshore wind developments, as the government anticipates their generation by 2028.\n“Actually, we’re done [already]. We’re about to hold a public consultation [this month],” she said. “We finished the terms of reference and the notice of auction; we’re just waiting for clearance.”	"\\tImages/govt-pushes-renewables-for-remote-areas-to-address-diesel-dependence_1.png"	The DOE and ADB collaborate on a $461 million program to upgrade off-grid systems, reducing reliance on imported diesel.  Off-grid areas, representing only 2% of national demand, use 85% imported oil for power generation.  Renewable energy offers a promising solution, though variable renewables are currently low at just over 3%. The DOE is working to enhance the financial viability of market platforms and minimize reliance on long-term off-take agreements.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/03/govt-pushes-renewables-for-remote-areas-to-address-diesel-dependence
another-round-of-fuel-price-hikes-expected	Another round of fuel price hikes expected	Motorists will need to brace themselves for another week of fuel price hikes.\nBased on the four-day trading in the Mean of Platts Singapore (MOPS), gasoline is expected to increase by around ₱0.90 to ₱1.4 per liter, while diesel is anticipated to rise by around ₱1 to ₱1.4 per liter. Kerosene may also inch up by ₱1 to ₱1.2 per liter.\nThese projected price adjustments were attributed to market movements involving the United States (US), China, and Iran, according to the Department of Energy (DOE) Oil Industry Management Bureau (OIMB).\nADVERTISEMENT\n"Crude prices extend gains on positive US-China trade signals," said Rodela Romero, OIMB director. Investors have been optimistic about a potential US-China trade deal, as upcoming economic talks could help ease tensions over China's export controls.\nDespite positive developments elsewhere, Romero noted that a slowdown influenced the oil price movements for the upcoming week in US trade negotiations with Iran. This caused some pessimism in prices, as analysts assumed the tensions between the two nations could result in supply disruption.\nMoreover, she noted that oil-producing countries expect oil demand to continue growing for the next two and a half decades. Jetti Petroleum elaborated that the rising demand could lessen the impact of increased oil production from OPEC+.\n"The demand optimism has outweighed worries about increased supply as OPEC+ further unwinds its production cuts, with higher oil demand seen within OPEC+ economies over the coming months, could offset the additional supply from the group and support oil prices," said Leo Bellas, Jetti President.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPrices did not rise further, likely due to stable Asian gasoline and diesel benchmarks. Bellas shared that these remained supported during the summer demand season, as China's fuel exports stayed low because of ongoing refinery maintenance.	"\\tImages/another-round-of-fuel-price-hikes-expected_1.png"	Fuel prices are expected to increase this week, with gasoline rising by ₱0.90 to ₱1.4 per liter and diesel by ₱1 to ₱1.4 per liter.  These hikes are due to market movements involving the US, China, and Iran.  Positive US-China trade signals offset some pessimism from US-Iran trade negotiations. Rising global oil demand could also support higher prices.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/13/another-round-of-fuel-price-hikes-expected

business-group-ramps-up-pressure-for-vp-dutertes-impeachment-trial	Business group ramps up pressure for VP Duterte's impeachment trial	An alliance of business organizations, foreign chambers, and civil society groups is pushing the Senate to act on the impeachment case of Vice President Sara Duterte, ramping up pressure from the private sector to fulfill its constitutional duty.\nThe Justice Reform Initiative (JRI), which advocates for the rule of law and an independent judiciary, stated that no one is above the Constitution—no matter how powerful.\n“No one, especially our elected senators, should make a mockery of the Constitution by substituting partisan politics for the rule of law,” the group said in a statement signed by its president Jose Jerome Pascual III.\nJRI acknowledged that while the impeachment case against Duterte could be “potentially precarious” to her political career, it also serves as the best opportunity to prove her innocence.\nTo recall, the country’s second highest official was impeached in February by the House of Representatives on the grounds of betrayal of public trust, culpable violation of the Constitution, bribery, graft and corruption, and other high crimes.\n“Any attempt by the Senate to remand, defer, or dismiss the Articles without trial is not merely irregular, it is unconstitutional,” said JRI.\nThe business group said there are only two outcomes in an impeachment trial—acquittal or conviction.\nIt emphasized that there is “no room for avoidance, no constitutional basis for indefinite deferral, even during transition to the 20th Congress”.\nThe Senate, acting as an impeachment court, faced criticism after it moved to return the articles of impeachment against Duterte to the lower chamber, citing the need to address supposed constitutional infirmities.\nThe House opted not to receive the articles of impeachment until the Senate provides clarification to the queries posed by the prosecution panel.\n“Public office is a public trust. It is not a refuge from accountability. Thus, to demand answers from our public servants is neither excessive, nor uncalled for because they are answerable to us,” JRI said.\nThe group added that senators must now “seize the moment” to serve the public and affirm their constitutional duty.\n“We call on them to rise above political loyalty, display their patriotic zeal, and respect their oath of allegiance to the Constitution and the rule of law,” it said.\nBased on its website, JRI’s membership roster includes the Management Association of the Philippines (MAP), the Financial Executives Institute of the Philippines (FINEX), and the Makati Business Club (MBC), among others.\nThe mentioned business clubs have separately issued statements urging lawmakers to proceed with the impeachment case.\nThe private sector fears that derailing the constitutional process could foster instability in the country, which may dissuade investments and economic growth.

bsp-rate-cut-geopolitical-tensions-to-steer-market-this-week	BSP rate cut, geopolitical tensions to steer market this week	Top influencers of investor sentiment this week will be the possible rate cut by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, overseas Filipino remittances, US-China trade talks, and the increasing tension in the Middle East.\n“The local market managed to extend its climb last week, backed by optimism on US-China trade relation prospects and expectations of a BSP rate cut in their meeting this week.\n“However, the market was not able to close above the 6,400 resistance line, reflecting lingering concerns over prevailing and new risks,” said Philstocks Financial Research Manager Japhet Tantiangco.\nHe noted that, while the market is seen to be undervalued, “Sentiment is expected to be challenged by ongoing Middle East tensions following Israel’s attack on Iran. A further escalation of such is expected to drive oil prices higher. This in turn may derail our country’s efforts against inflation. Pricing this in would be negative for the market.”\n“Investors are also expected to watch out for the BSP’s policy meeting. More than the interest rate decision, investors are expected to watch out for clues on the BSP’s policy direction.\n“Hints of more policy easing in the latter part of this year from the BSP may give sentiment a boost,” said Tantiangco.\nOnline brokerage 2TradeAsia.com said “Market volatility in the coming weeks will again gyrate on headlines, as U.S.-China trade negotiations take center stage once again.\n“While the White House is expected to finalize a new trade posture with China by July, we reiterate that trade policy uncertainty compresses corporate planning cycles, elongates supply chain risk premiums, and reinforces caution in global capex.”\n“The market remains tactically fragile, with price action seemingly dictated by event risk over macro trend conviction. Until greater clarity emerges on the trajectory of US-China trade negotiations and the Fed's response function, positioning should be built around optionality, balance sheet strength, and liquidity,” 2TradeAsia.com advised investors.\nFor stock picks, COL Financial recommends Jollibee Food Corporation since “We believe that the acquisition of Norang Tongdak positions JFC to scale more effectively in South Korea’s competitive market, with potential to drive business growth by leveraging its strong expertise in the fried chicken industry.\n“This follows the company’s successful acquisition of Compose Coffee, which continues to significantly support the growth of its international segment and demonstrates its ability to potentially succeed in the region’s food and beverage space.”\nMeanwhile, Unicapital Securities Research Analyst Jeri R. Alfonso recommends Universal Robina Corporation because “We believe the company is on track to hit its mid-single-digit bottomline growth guidance for 2025.\n“The strong momentum from both branded consumer food Philippines and International in the first quarter of 2025 sets a solid base for its full year performance this 2025.”	"\\tImages/bsp-rate-cut-geopolitical-tensions-to-steer-market-this-week_1.png"	Investor sentiment will be influenced by a potential BSP rate cut, overseas remittances, US-China trade talks, and Middle East tensions.  Market optimism is tempered by concerns over geopolitical risks and the 6,400 resistance line.  The BSP's policy direction and further easing hints are crucial for market sentiment.  COL Financial recommends Jollibee, while Unicapital suggests Universal Robina.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/16/bsp-rate-cut-geopolitical-tensions-to-steer-market-this-week

meralco-lowers-power-rates-for-second-straight-month-in-june	Meralco lowers power rates for second straight month in June	The Manila Electric Company (Meralco) announced a second consecutive month of electricity rate reduction this June, driven primarily by a decrease in the generation charge.\nIn a briefing, Joe R. Zaldarriaga, Meralco vice president and head of corporate communications, said the overall electricity rate for a typical household decreased by ₱0.1076 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), bringing the rate down to ₱12.1552 from ₱12.2628 per kWh in May.\nZaldarriaga noted that a typical household consuming 200 kWh would see an approximate ₱22 decrease in their June electricity bill.\nThe main driver behind this month's rate reduction is a ₱0.1099 per kWh decrease in the generation charge, bringing it to ₱7.3552 per kWh. According to Meralco, this reduction was primarily due to lower charges from Power Supply Agreements (PSAs), Independent Power Producers (IPPs), and the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM). \nPSAs and IPPs saw charges decrease by ₱0.3699 and ₱0.1034 per kWh, respectively, attributed to lower fuel costs and higher average dispatch.\nWESM charges also dropped by ₱0.6342 per kWh due to an improved supply situation in the Luzon grid during May. Zaldarriaga said this improvement was a result of a 533 MW reduction in average capacity on outage, which offset a 527 MW increase in average demand. \nPSAs, IPPs, and WESM accounted for 48 percent, 33 percent, and 18 percent of Meralco’s total energy requirement for the period, respectively.\nWhile the generation charge decreased, the transmission charge increased by ₱0.0214 per kWh due to higher ancillary service charges from the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines’ (NGCP) Ancillary Service Procurement Agreements and the Reserve Market. However, this was more than offset by the reduction in the generation charge. \nOther charges, including taxes, registered a net decrease of ₱0.0191 per kWh. \nMeralco stated that its distribution charge has remained unchanged since August 2022, and customers continue to benefit from an ongoing distribution-related true-up adjustment, which provides a ₱0.2024 per kWh reduction for residential customers.\nMeralco reminded qualified customers to apply for available subsidy mechanisms such as the lifeline rate program and the senior citizen discount. \nMeanwhile, theNGCP reported a drop in the wheeling rates during May at ₱0.4593/kWh.\nWheeling rates are charges for transmitting power from plants to distribution utilities (DU) through the grid.\nThe ancillary services (AS), however, increased to ₱0.5655/kWh.	"\\tImages/meralco-lowers-power-rates-for-second-straight-month-in-june_1.png"	Meralco announced a second consecutive month of electricity rate reduction in June, lowering the overall rate by ₱0.1076 per kWh.  The decrease is mainly due to lower generation charges from PSAs, IPPs, and WESM. A typical household using 200 kWh will see roughly a ₱22 reduction.  Despite a slight transmission charge increase, the overall rate decrease benefits consumers.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/11/meralco-lowers-power-rates-for-second-straight-month-in-june

bir-targets-major-service-upgrade-with-18-billion-budget-bid-for-2026	BIR targets major service upgrade with ₱18-billion budget bid for 2026	Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Commissioner Romeo Lumagui Jr. said the government’s main tax agency’s ₱18 billion proposal for 2026 covers plans to build a tax-focused contact center and office space expansion to accommodate more taxpayers and reduce queues.\n“We want to improve our facilities and we want to improve our digital transformation because it will greatly increase our efficiency in tax collections,” Romeo said during a Kapihan sa Manila Bay press briefing on Wednesday, June 18.\nHe said the agency has proposed a budget of about ₱15 billion to ₱18 billion, rising from ₱16.9 billion this year.\n“Hopefully this time, the budget I requested for the contact center will be granted—because last year, it was not given to us,” Lumagui said, adding that the estimated annual budget to fund the contact center will be around ₱150 million.\n“It’s like a call center—toll-free nationwide, that’s the goal. Especially in the provinces, imagine people traveling for several hours just to ask simple questions to the BIR, when it could easily be handled over the phone,” Lumagui explained.\nHe added that the contact center is “centralized. It’s a small investment, but the improvement in services would be significant and truly felt by taxpayers.”\nAside from the usual programs, Lumagui said the agency is also prioritizing infrastructure projects, as some of its offices are still renting small, cramped spaces.\n“Imagine, some of our offices are just big enough for the employees, so taxpayers end up lining up outside. That’s why we want to move to a place that can accommodate more taxpayers inside, more conveniently,” he said.\nAlso, the BIR is pushing to equip all district offices with e-lounges, requesting additional computers so each lounge can have at least four to five units available for taxpayers.\nAccording to the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), agency budget proposals for 2026 have already ballooned to around ₱11 trillion as of May, surpassing this year’s ₱9.2-trillion worth of funding requests.\nThis was attributed to numerous programs and projects (PAPs) being eagerly pushed by agencies. As such, the 2026 budget proposal is expected to exceed 2025’s ₱6.326-trillion appropriations and reach a new record high.\nGiven the country’s “limited fiscal space,” new budget proposals are being evaluated based on their alignment with the Marcos administration’s priorities, readiness for implementation, and the absorptive capacity of implementing agencies.\nBIR’s proposed contact center and office expansion fall under infrastructure development, which is the Marcos administration’s first priority in the list, as per the 2026 budget priorities framework briefer published early June.\nInfrastructure development specifically includes investments in active transport, integrated water resources, agriculture and healthcare facilities, and digital connectivity.	"\\tImages/bir-targets-major-service-upgrade-with-18-billion-budget-bid-for-2026_1.png"	The BIR aims for a major service upgrade with an ₱18 billion budget for 2026, including a nationwide toll-free contact center and office expansions.  This aims to improve tax collection efficiency and reduce taxpayer wait times. The contact center is projected to cost ₱150 million annually.  The upgrades are aligned with the Marcos administration's infrastructure development priorities.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/18/bir-targets-major-service-upgrade-with-18-billion-budget-bid-for-2026
arta-to-intensify-crackdown-on-lgus-non-compliant-with-ease-of-doing-business-mandate	ARTA to intensify crackdown on LGUs non-compliant with ease of doing business mandate	The Anti-Red Tape Authority (ARTA) is ramping up its efforts to make the Philippines more attractive for investors by cracking down on local government units (LGUs) that have yet to comply with the government’s mandate in ease of doing business.\nLast week, ARTA Secretary Ernesto Perez shared before the World Trade Organization's (WTO) Council for Trade in Services meeting the country’s experiences in leveraging good regulatory practices (GRPs) to facilitate international trade.\nDuring the meeting, Perez said he affirmed the country’s commitment in making sure that regulations are transparent and consistent, aligning with international benchmarks.\nOn the part of the administration, he said one of the most urgent initiatives for transparency is to ensure that all LGUs are implementing the electronic business one-stop shop (e-BOSS) system.\n“Problema talaga dito sa [LGUs] ‘pag mahigpit doon, masisira tayo. Kasi, first impression eh. Before you can engage in business, kailangan mo kumuha ng business permit. Kung doon lang mismo nahirapan ka na, it creates a bad impression. Investors will turn away,” Perez told Manila Bulletin in an interview.\n(The problem with some LGUs is that when they’re too restrictive, it hurts us. It’s all about first impressions. Before you can even start doing business, you need to get a business permit. If that process alone is already difficult, it creates a bad impression. Investors will turn away.)\nUnder Republic Act (RA) No. 11032, or the Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act, LGUs are mandated to build an online portal to process business permits, payments, clearances, and other government documents.\nEnacted in 2018, the law required cities and municipalities to establish their respective e-BOSS systems within three years of the law’s effectivity.\nFast forward to 2025, Perez said his agency has flagged 463 non-compliant LGUs.\nOf this number, ARTA has filed charges against 117 LGUs after snubbing the agency’s notices to explain.\n“Kung wala man lang ginawa, wala man lang explanation, then may basis to file charges,” said Perez.\n(If nothing is done, there is no explanation, then there is a basis to file charges.)\nThe ARTA chief stated that of the LGUs who submitted their explanations, the majority of them are blaming the lack of resources and poor internet connection.\nHe found this reasoning absurd as even sixth-class municipalities, such as Guinsiliban town in the province of Camiguin, have followed through with the digitization effort.\n“Ang sagot really is political will, depende sa mayor kung gusto niya o hindi. Kung gusto niya, may paraan,” Perez told Manila Bulletin.\n(The real answer is political will, it depends on the mayor whether they want it or not. If they want it, they’ll find a way.)\nOpting out of transparency, according to Perez, would only lead to red tape and corruption.\n“This is precisely what the law avoids, we need to be streamlined and digital. The President is very clear on that,” he added.\nIn its annual report on foreign trade barriers, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) identified the “pervasive and longstanding” corruption as one of the biggest barriers to trade with the Philippines.	"\\tImages/arta-to-intensify-crackdown-on-lgus-non-compliant-with-ease-of-doing-business-mandate_1.png"	ARTA is intensifying its crackdown on non-compliant LGUs to improve the Philippines' ease of doing business.  463 LGUs are non-compliant, with charges filed against 117.  Many LGUs cite resource and internet issues, but ARTA counters that political will is the key.  Lack of transparency leads to red tape and corruption, hindering trade.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/19/arta-to-intensify-crackdown-on-lgus-non-compliant-with-ease-of-doing-business-mandate

bsp-says-no-reason-to-intervene-as-peso-falls-to-57451	BSP says 'no reason to intervene' as peso falls to ₱57.45:$1	Since the peso’s depreciation was seen at the onset of Israel’s attack on Iran, the local currency continued losing strength against the United States (US) dollar.\nOn Thursday, June 19, the local currency, shedding nearly half a peso, closed at ₱57.45 from ₱56.98 last Wednesday. The closing rate was also the peso’s intraday low.\nIt reached an intraday high of ₱57.1 after opening at the same level, according to the Bankers Association of the Philippines (BAP).\nTotal trading volume inched up to $1.834 billion from Tuesday's $1.266 billion.\n“Usually when the peso depreciates or seems to depreciate, for reasons that are really about the strong dollar,” Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Eli M. Remolona Jr. told a press briefing on Thursday after the policy-setting Monetary Board (MB) lowered key interest rates by 25 basis points (bps).\nRemolona cited how the peso and other currencies lost footing against the US dollar.\n“In the last few days, we saw the dollar strengthen because of global tensions, so safe haven flows into the dollar,” he said.\n“To intervene strongly, just to maintain the exchange rate of the peso to the dollar would be futile,” Remolona asserted.\n“We won’t have enough reserves to do that. So we would intervene just for regular liquidity reasons,” the central bank chief explained.\nIf the peso continues to depreciate, Remolona said the central bank would have to intervene “more seriously,” considering that the pass-through effect of peso depreciation “has come back to haunt us.”\nAccording to Remolona, the pass-through now—a massive decline in peso that leads to inflation—is “very different from before.”\nFor now, the BSP Governor “does not see any reason” to intervene amid the peso slide, as he argued that moderate depreciations have no effect on the inflation environment.\n“When they’re big enough, it usually takes a few weeks of continuous depreciation. Then we might intervene,” he concluded.

For now, however, he sees no reason to intervene, as moderate depreciations have no effect on inflation.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/19/bsp-says-no-reason-to-intervene-as-peso-falls-to-57451
dotr-seeks-3-billion-for-new-lrt-1-station-in-bacoor	DOTr seeks ₱3 billion for new LRT-1 station in Bacoor	The Department of Transportation (DOTr) is looking for an additional ₱3 billion in its budget next year to build an additional station in Bacoor, Cavite as part of the Cavite Extension project of the Light Rail Transit Line 1 (LRT-1).\nTransportation Secretary Vince Dizon said his agency has requested additional funding support from the government to build Talaba station, which will be situated between the future stations of Zapote and Niog.\nThe new station, which will be developed within the proposed line alignment of the extension project, was personally requested by the local government of Bacoor.\n“This was a request by Bacoor, and it makes sense because Talaba station is in the area where there are new developments in Bacoor City,” said Dizon in a chance interview.\nLast year, phase 1 of the LRT-1 Cavite Extension project was formally opened to the public, opening five additional stations to the 20.7-kilometer rail line.\nPhase 2 of the extension will include the Las Piñas and Zapote stations, with the project culminating in Phase 3 to build the Niog station in Bacoor.\nWith the three additional stations already being developed by Light Rail Manila Corp. (LRMC), the DOTr will shoulder the funding for the construction of Talaba station.\nDizon said LRMC, the private operator of LRT-1, already gave the agency its thumbs up for the new station.\n“The government will pay for the station, and of course, we will pass it to LRMC for them to run it,” he said, noting that the construction will be up for bidding.\nSince the new station will be within the same alignment of the extension, harmonization of the project is anticipated to be seamless.\nDizon has expressed his confidence that Phase 2 of the project will be operational in 2028.\nPhase 3, which will now cover two stations, is expected to be completed by 2030.\nSo far, the DOTr has yet to estimate the potential ridership at the future Talaba station.\nHowever, Dizon said it will likely have a huge ridership given potential developments in Bacoor.\nExcluding Talaba station, the original eight stations under the extension project could accommodate an additional 300,000 passengers daily.\nLast year, LRT-1’s ridership averaged around 320,000 daily passengers.

batangas-bohol-negros-occidental-gain-new-ecozones-as-govt-pushes-countryside-devt	Batangas, Bohol, Negros Occidental gain new ecozones as gov't pushes countryside dev't	The Marcos administration has proclaimed four new economic zones (ecozones) and expansions during the first half of the year, signaling the government’s ongoing drive to facilitate investments outside the country’s urban centers.\nDuring the period, President Marcos approved two expansion projects of a manufacturing zone in Batangas and two new information technology (IT) parks in Bohol and Negros Occidental.\nThe Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) said the government’s push to amplify countryside development through these new ecozones will facilitate growth and new investments across the country’s regions.\n“The ecozones will play a vital role in attracting the much-needed investments in the country, generating more jobs for Filipinos, and contributing in accelerating the nation’s socio-economic progress,” PEZA Director General Tereso Panga said in a statement.\nIn May of this year, Marcos issued Proclamation No. 910 and 846, approving the expansions of Lima Technology Center in Batangas, which is expected to cost a combined total of more than ₱1.4 billion.\nIn total, 42.71 hectares of land in Brgy. Bagong Pook and Luta Sur in Malvar, Batangas will be developed for the expansion projects.\nExpected to be completed by June 2027, these new areas are seen to significantly enhance the number of locators in Lima Technology Center.\nPEZA said this will also boost the contributions of the ecozone developer, Aboitiz InfraCapital, in enabling the investment promotion agency (IPA) to entice more investments into the country.\nEarly this month, Marcos signed Proclamation No. 919 which designated 33.96 hectares of land in Brgy. 41, Bacolod City in Negros Occidental to be an IT park.\nTo be operated by real estate developer Megaworld Corp., the site will be the future home of the Upper East.\nThe company is set to invest about ₱1.6 billion for the development of the project, which includes the construction of two IT buildings.\nFive IT-business process outsourcing (BPO) companies are expected to operate in the ecozone, creating an estimated of 2,500 direct jobs.\nLastly, Marcos issued Proclamation No. 821, which designated 11,237 square meters of land in Dampas, Tagbilaran City in Leyte as an IT Park.\nBuilding on the success of the existing 1.4-hectare Tagbilaran Uptown IT Hub 1, the new ecozone will be known as Tagbilaran IT Hub 2, with development costing over ₱200 million.\nPEZA said a prospective locator has already expressed interest in investing up to ₱70 million in the area, potentially hiring over 500 Filipinos.\nWith the addition of four new sites, this brings the total of ecozones proclaimed under the Marcos administration to 32. Combined, these projects have committed ₱13.406 in investments.\nAccording to Panga, PEZA will continue to engage with local governments and developers to develop new ecozones in the country.\nLast year, he stated that the agency is targeting the proclamation of at least 30 ecozones this year, with a heavy focus in countryside development.\nUnder the law, ecozones and the benefits they will be granted by the government are only established once proclaimed by the president.	"\\tImages/batangas-bohol-negros-occidental-gain-new-ecozones-as-govt-pushes-countryside-devt_1.png"	Four new economic zones and expansions were proclaimed in the Philippines, boosting countryside development.  These include two IT parks and expansions of a manufacturing zone, attracting investments and creating jobs.  The projects are expected to generate significant economic growth across different regions.  PEZA aims to continue developing more ecozones nationwide, focusing on countryside development.  This initiative is expected to bring substantial investments and employment opportunities.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/18/batangas-bohol-negros-occidental-gain-new-ecozones-as-govt-pushes-countryside-devt
bcda-delivers-record-52-billion-to-treasury-exceeds-dividend-target	BCDA delivers record ₱5.2 billion to treasury, exceeds dividend target	State-run Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) has remitted ₱2.04 billion in cash dividends to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr), equivalent to 80 percent of its net income last year, the Department of Finance (DOF) reported.\nApart from this being “the highest amount” the BCDA has contributed, the DOF noted that this amount also went beyond the DOF’s mandate for government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCC) to remit 75 percent of their net income.\nOn top of the over ₱2-billion in dividends, the BCDA remitted ₱3.1 billion as a share of its asset disposition proceeds collected in 2024. This increased the GOCCs’ total contribution to ₱5.2 billion.\n“Not only are you fulfilling your duties—you’re even going beyond,” Finance Secretary Ralph G. Recto said during the ceremonial turnover on Monday, June 16.\nThe remittance aligns with President Marcos’ order to uphold fiscal discipline among GOCCs, which ensures that the government “maximizes non-tax revenues to fund priority programs without the need to impose new taxes on the people.”\nRecto said the total amount could be used to build 2,000 classrooms, provide fertilizer for over 500,000 hectares of rice farms, or fund 250 million hot meals for children. If properly allocated to the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), it could improve soldiers’ welfare and equipment.\nRecto committed to “strongly support” the BCDA’s efforts to maximize the value of its assets to help raise its earnings and increase its dividends to the government.\n“Every idle land you turn into a wealth-creating hub becomes a job generator, a talent magnet, an income booster, and a hope multiplier,” Recto stressed.\nHe said the railway to Clark and the subway to Bonifacio Global City (BGC) show the government’s strong confidence in the ongoing viability of converting former military bases, aiming to attract more investors and create more opportunities for Filipinos.\nFor his part, BCDA president and CEO Joshua Bingcang said the state-run firm “remains fully committed to doing our part to grow regional economies, unlock more opportunities, and help build a stronger and more inclusive Philippines.”\nThe BCDA is tasked with helping modernize the Armed Forces while developing major business hubs and communities such as BGC, New Clark City, and Newport City.\nLast month, the DOF said it is confident that total collections from GOCCs this year will surpass the more than ₱136 billion recorded in 2024.\nTotal dividends collected by the DOF for the first four months declined by 14.2 percent to ₱76 billion from ₱88.6 billion in the same period in 2024. Last year’s total dividends was remitted by 47 GOCCs.	"\\tImages/bcda-delivers-record-52-billion-to-treasury-exceeds-dividend-target_1.png"	BCDA remitted a record ₱5.2 billion to the treasury, exceeding its dividend target.  This includes ₱2.04 billion in cash dividends and ₱3.1 billion from asset disposition.  The remittance surpasses the government's mandate for GOCCs and aligns with President Marcos's fiscal discipline order.  The funds can be used for various projects, including infrastructure and social programs.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/17/bcda-delivers-record-52-billion-to-treasury-exceeds-dividend-target

bir-may-revise-32-trillion-collection-target-amid-slower-gdp-growth	BIR may revise ₱3.2-trillion collection target amid slower GDP growth	Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Commissioner Romeo Lumagui Jr. confirmed that the agency’s current collection target of ₱3.2 trillion may be revised due to the country’s slower-than-expected gross domestic product (GDP) growth.\n“If you follow the GDP growth, there should be a recalibration of the collection target,” Lumagui said during the Kapihan sa Manila Bay press briefing on Wednesday, June 18.\nTalks regarding the collection targets of the country’s biggest tax collection agencies—BIR and Bureau of Customs (BOC)—are ongoing. Lumagui said these actions are being made because revenue targets are “dependent on the economic growth of the country.”\nLast month, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported that the country’s economic output expanded modestly by 5.4 percent in the first quarter of 2025, outpacing the 5.3 percent growth in the previous quarter.\nThis growth was almost stagnant and markedly slower than the 5.7 percent growth seen in the first quarter of 2024. It also fell significantly short of the government’s target of six to eight percent.\nLumagui said that a revision of the collection target is “possible given the actual GDP growth.” The Washington-based World Bank recently maintained its forecast that the Philippine economy this year will only grow around the midpoint of five percent and six percent.\n“So we are discussing what the appropriate collection target for the BIR should be, but as of now, it’s still at ₱3.2 trillion — nothing has changed yet,” Lumagui said.\nHe said that the BIR “has been working double-time in making sure that our revenue collection target will be met this year,” adding that the agency is “right on track in achieving our target.”\nHe, however, noted that the country’s economic growth is “not going as projected.” Thus, raising the likelihood of revising the agency’s full-year revenue target.\nFor the January-to-April period, the BIR, the country’s largest tax collection agency, collected a cumulative total of ₱1.11 trillion, 34.4 percent of its 2025 target. It accounted for 77.6 percent of the government’s total tax revenues for the four months.\nMeanwhile, the BOC, the country’s second-largest tax collection agency, raked in a total of ₱306.1 billion during the period. It now accounts for 28.9 percent of the ₱1.06 trillion target for the year. It accounted for over 21.4 percent of the government’s total tax revenues.\nTo recall, the BIR exceeded its collection target in 2024, posting a 20-year-high. Lumagui had said that the agency will mark another record for 2025.\nMeanwhile, the BOC fell short of its 2024 goal, blaming the recent rice tariffs reduction and delayed tax reforms.	"\\tImages/bir-may-revise-32-trillion-collection-target-amid-slower-gdp-growth_1.png"	The BIR's ₱3.2 trillion collection target may be revised due to slower-than-expected GDP growth.  Revenue targets depend on economic growth, and the first quarter of 2025 showed only 5.4% growth.  Discussions are ongoing regarding the appropriate collection target for the BIR.  For January-April, the BIR collected ₱1.11 trillion, 34.4% of its 2025 target.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/18/bir-may-revise-32-trillion-collection-target-amid-slower-gdp-growth
china-bank-savings-keeps-breaking-profit-records-unfazed-by-rivals	China Bank Savings keeps breaking profit records, unfazed by rivals	China Bank Savings (CBS), the retail lending arm of the SM Group’s China Banking Corporation, sees enough room for competition in the thrift banking segment, even from BDO Network Bank, as it continues to post strong earnings growth.\nIn a chat with media after the bank’s annual stockholders’ meeting, CBS President James Christian T. Dee pointed out that BDONB and CSB are both part of the SM Group, “so we actually welcome the entry of BDO Network Bank.”\n“And, knowing BDO, I won't be surprised if they will be growing much, much faster over the next few years. But this is actually a welcome development for thrift banks,” he added.\nDee explained that “the thrift banking space is not as big as the commercial banks. So we do actually want stronger and more stable players to come in to make thrift banking more accessible to the unbanked.”\n“We normally try to present the thrift banks as those who actually reach out to the unbanked in the more remote areas of the Philippines. So this is something that we welcome more players,” he said.\nFor his part, CBS chairman Ricardo R. Chua said that, as consumer spending is the major driver of the economy, the consumer side of the banking business may grow significantly over the next few years.\n“We have a very young population, everybody wants to work, everybody wants to be productive. So we thought it's a growing market. Having BDO is a welcome development, but it will not derail us from whatever plans we have in growing the bank,” Chua said.\nDespite the industry’s growing focus on digital banks, CBS continues to open brick-and-mortar branches nationwide to serve the unbanked market, officials said. It plans to add five more branches this year to its nationwide network of 170 branches, 107 lending centers, and about 250 ATMs.\n“Hopefully, by the third or early fourth quarter of this year, we should open an additional five branches. Mostly in the VizMin area. We noted a huge potential in the southern part of the Philippines. We do want to strengthen our network in the southern part of the Philippines,” Dee said.\nCBS grew its profit by 23 percent in the first quarter of 2025, building on record-breaking income realized in 2024. Dee said the bank hit a net income of ₱566 million in the first quarter, up 23 percent from the same period in 2024, as total loans expanded to ₱143 billion, while total deposits grew to ₱171 billion.\n“First quarter GDP growth of the Philippines, came in at a modest 5.4 percent, reflecting a relatively flat growth trajectory spanning the last three quarters. In spite of this, I am happy to report that CBS has done well to start the year,” Dee said.\nHe pointed out that, “2024 was another strong year for our Bank, and I am proud to announce that CBS has delivered record-breaking profits for four consecutive years.”\nChua said “CBS is determined to expand our business through loans and CASA growth and to future-proof our organization by focusing on asset quality, digital banking transformation, and the consolidation of our distribution network.”	"\\tImages/china-bank-savings-keeps-breaking-profit-records-unfazed-by-rivals_1.png"	China Bank Savings (CBS) reported a 23 percent profit increase in Q1 2025, continuing its record-breaking streak.

car-sales-see-slowest-growth-in-over-a-year	Car sales see slowest growth in over a year	Vehicle sales in the Philippines remained sluggish, growing by only 1.7 percent in May, the lowest growth rate in over a year, as demand for passenger cars continued to weaken.\nA joint report by the Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines Inc. (CAMPI) and the Truck Manufacturers Association (TMA) showed that sales in the first five months of the year reached 190,429 units.\nIn contrast, 187,191 cars were sold in the country from January to May last year.\nAt a growth rate of only 1.7 percent, this marks as the slowest increase in sales since the 1.6 percent growth in March of 2024\nThe slow growth in May is seen as a continuation of the decline in the previous month of 2.5 percent, which dipped from the 6-percent growth in March.\nHowever, taking into account May alone, car sales rebounded with 39,775 units, up 18.4 percent from 33,580 in April.\nThis is a strong turnaround from last month’s sales, which fell 10 percent from 40,306 units in March.\nCAMPI President Rommel Gutierrez said this recovery was driven in large part by the popularity of the commercial vehicle segment.\nCommercial vehicles, typically used by businesses to transport goods, saw 31,880 units sold in May. This is a 17.7-percent hike from the previous month’s 27,082 units.\nIn the first five months of the year, the segment notched 151,704 units, which jumped 10 percent from 137,944 during the same period in 2024.\n“We are encouraged by the industry’s sustained growth, especially with commercial vehicles driving overall performance, said Gutierrez.\n“This reaffirms the significant role of the automotive sector in supporting the country’s economic activities,” he added.\nOn the other hand, passenger cars continue to decline, recording 38,725 sales by the end of May, compared to 49,247 units in the prior year.\nNonetheless, there are positive signs for the segment as last month saw sales reached 7,895, which is a 21.5-percent improvement from 6,498 in April.\nJoint CAMPI-TMA data also showed a rising demand for electric vehicles (EVs), with last month racking up 3,613 units versus April’s 1,509 units.\nOver the five-month period, 10,433 EVs have been sold in the country.\nGutierrez said this signals a more positive second half of the year, with the market’s continued recovery deemed to be already underway.\n“Continued collaboration between government and industry stakeholders will be key to sustaining this growth,” he added.\nFor the first five months of the year, Toyota Motor Philippines Corp. remains the industry’s most dominant player with 48.13 percent market share, selling a total of 91,652 units.\nMitsubishi Motors Philippines Corp. followed this with a 19.23-percent market share, Nissan Philippines Inc. with 5.19 percent, Suzuki Philippines Inc. with 4.68 percent, and Ford Group Philippines at 4.49 percent.

dti-launches-1-billion-loan-program-for-women-entrepreneurs	DTI launches ₱1-billion loan program for women entrepreneurs	The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) is set to roll out a ₱1-billion loan program for prospective women entrepreneurs, as part of the agency’s broader effort to diversify income opportunities for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). During the media launch of the Section G: Job Blueprint for Wholesale and Retail Trade on Monday, June 16, DTI Secretary Cristina Roque said this loan is the latest initiative of Small Business (SB) Corp. SB Corp., the financing arm of the DTI, has allocated ₱10 billion in funding this year for the loan programs of MSMEs. The state-run firm’s financing programs include business expansion, purchase order, franchising loan, wholesome loan, and enterprise rehabilitation, among others. “Soon I'll be launching a ₱1 billion women's enterprise fund. So, the women that want to get into business will be able to borrow from SB Corp.,” Roque said in a chance interview. The DTI chief said this loan program will be available for all women looking to establish a business in the country. While other details were not disclosed, the loan is expected to have no required collateral, which means a loanee will no longer need to pledge a valuable asset as security for the loan. Roque added that payment for the loan will start in the second year, with loanees having the option to “choose interest alone, or principal alone, or below principal and interest.” Similar to other loans under SB Corp., those who want to tap the women’s enterprise fund will be able to get a loan with just their government ID. If qualified, the loan will likely be approved within a week. On Monday, the DTI officially launched the Section G: Job Blueprint, in partnership with the Philippine Retailers Association (PRA) and the Supply Chain Management Association of the Philippines (SCMAP). According to the DTI, the blueprint will serve as a framework designed to boost competitiveness and enhance resilience of wholesale and retail businesses, from major distributors to sari-sari stores. Based on government data, the wholesale and retail sector accounted for approximately 75 percent of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) last year, valued at ₱20 trillion. Among its main priorities is to empower sari-sari stores by enabling them to earn income through other sources. Roque said this vision will be realized through the so-called sari-sari store fund, which will allow owners access to loans to expand their businesses beyond retail. “We need to let them diversify. So, what is the best way? Number one, service. Because sari-sari stores cater to the community around,” she said. For instance, the secretary suggested that small business owners could shift to services such as salon and massage to keep their income going despite slowdown in sales.

dotr-revives-plans-to-build-espana-quezon-busway-line	DOTr revives plans to build España-Quezon busway line	The Department of Transportation (DOTr) is reviving the plan to build a busway line that will provide commuters with a more seamless commute between Manila and Quezon City.\nTransportation Secretary Vince Dizon said his agency is currently studying the prospect of building a new bus rapid transit (BRT) system along the roughly 12-kilometer route of España Boulevard in Manila to Quezon Avenue in Quezon City.\nDizon said the proposed route is a top priority for the government, as it will provide commuters with another option for commuting, instead of the jeepney or through ride-hailing apps.\nThe project is currently undergoing a feasibility study that is expected to be completed by next year.\nCurrently, the plan is for the government to build the busway line before turning over the operations and maintenance to the private sector.\nDizon said the construction of the project will not be complicated, recalling that the EDSA Carousel was developed even during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nIt was during the pandemic when the government first planned to erect a busway line along España Boulevard to Quezon Avenue, with an estimated cost of ₱5.4 billion.\nIn a report by the Congressional Policy and Budget Research Department (CPBRD) of the House of Representatives, the proposed BRT system was conceptualized in 2016 and was planned to run from Philcoa in Quezon City to Manila City Hall.\nThe project was seen to cut travel time between the two stations from two hours to 40 minutes, serving up to 300,000 passengers daily.\nThe government has sought financial support from the World Bank to the tune of $64.6 million, or about ₱3.67 billion, for the project.\nHowever, the loan was cancelled in 2022, with the Washington-based multilateral lender citing the inefficiency in procurement, supposed weak capacity of the implementing agency, and pandemic-induced delays.\nWith the project’s revival, the DOTr is planning to intensify its efforts to build more BRT systems across the country.\nDizon said the Cebu BRT system in Cebu City, which has long been plagued by delays, is now under construction.\nHe added that another priority project is the Davao BRT system, which he described as “game-changer” as it will be the template busway line for other cities.

european-digital-bank-seeks-philippine-license-bsp	European digital bank seeks Philippine license—BSP	While several digital banks are interested in securing banking licenses from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), only one foreign digital bank has formally submitted an application, offering to plug the credit scoring and other gaps in existing entities.\nBSP Deputy Governor Chuchi G. Fonacier told reporters on the sidelines of the ceremonial launch of the Protect Your Money (PYM) campaign on Tuesday, June 17, that “there’s only one” digital bank that has proceeded to process the requirements necessary to secure a digital banking license.\n“As far as I know, there’s only one—because the others are just expressions of interest. But this one, they really have the requirements that need to be completed,” Fonacier, who handles the central bank’s financial supervision sector, said.\nAccording to Fonacier, this applicant is a European digital bank that “already did the paperwork, but there are some that are still lacking in the documentary requirements.”\n“It’s still in the initial stage. There are requirements that need to be hurdled,” Fonacier said.\nEarlier this year, Fonacier said that among the major considerations of the central bank in the search for new players is the “unique and very good value proposition” not being offered by the six existing digital banks.\nAmong the major gaps identified by the central bank that the European digital bank aims to address are issues related to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and credit scoring.\nOut of the six existing licensed digital banks, only two have so far registered profits, while the others are still in the early stages of operations, Fonacier noted, adding that this trend is expected, as startups typically go through a build-up phase to establish their presence and customer base.\nOn the other hand, she said that the prospects for digital banks in the country appear more promising compared to other markets with the same number of players.\nCurrently, six digital banks have been granted digital banking licenses by the BSP, including Maya Bank, UnionDigital Bank, Overseas Filipino Bank, Tonik Digital Bank, UNObank, and GOtyme.\nAt the start of the year, the BSP lifted the ban on new digital banking licenses in the Philippines, opening up opportunities for new players to enter the sector.

employers-ditch-congress-let-wage-boards-handle-pay-hikes	Employers: Ditch Congress, let wage boards handle pay hikes	The country’s leading group of employers said all future salary adjustments should be overseen solely by the regional wage boards, rather than through legislation that was recently left unapproved by Congress.\n“The regional wage board is not perfect, but that is the most objective and thoughtful way to do [wage hikes],” said Employers Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP) President Sergio Ortiz-Luis Jr.\nOrtiz-Luis issued the statement following the 19th Congress’ failure to convene as a bicameral conference committee to reconcile the two chambers’ versions of wage hike bills.\nThe Senate approved the bill granting a ₱100 across-the-board wage hike for workers in the private sector last year, while the House of Representatives approved the ₱200 early this month.\nIf it had been approved, it would have been the first time a legislated wage hike was enacted since 1989.\nMoving forward, Ortiz-Luis said he will be opposed to future wage hike measures as he sees no need for Congress to pursue such adjustments.\n“As long as the proposal made no sense, did not undergo study by the wage experts, and was based on either politics or emotions, the group [will not be] amenable to it,” he said.\nThe ECOP official said wage boards already comprise key representatives from the private, public and labor sectors which undertake annual reviews of salaries in every region.\nThe regional wage boards were specifically established to determine and set region-specific rates based on the local cost of living.\nOrtiz-Luis noted that employers sometimes disagree with the wage board’s decision but they nonetheless support its moves.\nWhile he acknowledged that these boards do not typically approve substantial hikes, the initial request will eventually be met through steady increases.\n“From having the lowest minimum wage in ASEAN, through the year-by-year increases, we now have the highest,” he pointed out.\nOrtiz-Luis warns that if a legislative wage hike gets the president’s approval, it would impact at least 98 percent of the industries in the country.\nHe added that it would only affect 10 to 16 percent of the 52 million workers in the country, leaving out the majority of the workers who are under the informal sector.	"\\tImages/employers-ditch-congress-let-wage-boards-handle-pay-hikes_1.png"	The Employers Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP) prefers regional wage boards to handle pay increases, opposing congressional intervention.  ECOP President Ortiz-Luis believes wage boards offer a more objective approach, citing their annual salary reviews and regional cost-of-living considerations.  He argues that legislative hikes would impact most industries but only a small percentage of workers.  The current system, while resulting in smaller increases, has led to the Philippines having the highest minimum wage in ASEAN.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/21/employers-ditch-congress-let-wage-boards-handle-pay-hikes
auroras-apeco-acquires-land-to-develop-commercial-airport	Aurora's APECO acquires land to develop commercial airport	The Aurora Pacific Economic Zone and Freeport Authority (APECO) has secured additional land to develop an existing airstrip into a commercial airport, providing investors direct access to the ecozone.\nIn a statement, APECO said it has sealed an agreement with the Chua Cham family to acquire 12 hectares of land in Brgy. Esteves in the town of Casiguran.\nUnder the deal, the Chua Cham family donated 5.2 hectares of land while selling an additional 6.8 hectares to APECO.\n“APECO’s potential to do more depends on the amount of land we administer. In our continuing land acquisition efforts, we were left with higher rates beyond the zonal valuation,” said APECO President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Gil Taway IV.\n“APECO, however, was able to acquire the property from the Chua Cham family at 50 percent less than the previous buying rate, which we consider highly advantageous to the government,” he added.\nTaway said obtaining new land is a “major step” in connecting the Casiguran-based ecozone to the global investment market.\nThe 1.320-kilometer Casiguran airstrip, which is planned to be developed as the APECO Airport, is seen to improve accessibility to Aurora and northeastern Luzon.\nAPECO stated that the operationalization of this Airport will boost investments in the ecozone, as it will provide direct air links for business travelers, investors, and cargo.\nBased on its website, the existing airstrip in APECO can only be reached by way of private flight.\nEarlier this year, the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) inspected and assessed the airstrip’s condition, paving the way for recommendations for the issuance of a Permit to Operate (PTO).\nAt present, there are four feeder airports in Aurora, with the nearest being Dr. Juan C. Angara Airport in San Luis, Aurora, located seven kilometers from the ecozone.\nThe closest major airports are Clark International Airport and Ninoy Aquino International Airport, which are 265.9 kilometers and 319 kilometers away, respectively.\nAside from potential new investments, APECO said building the airport will also be a boon for the tourism sector given the natural tourist attractions in the area, including beaches and its rich biodiversity.\n“We are working with CAAP and other key agencies to fast-track this project,” said Taway. “The APECO Airport will not only serve as a gateway to Aurora but it will be a gateway to new opportunities for the Philippines.”	"\\tImages/auroras-apeco-acquires-land-to-develop-commercial-airport_1.png"	APECO secured 12 hectares of land to develop a Casiguran airstrip into a commercial airport, boosting ecozone accessibility.

bsp-chief-remolona-twice-more-interest-rate-cuts-depending-on-economic-data-after-june-19-easing	BSP chief Remolona: 'Twice more' interest rate cuts depending on economic data after June 19 easing	After the widely expected 25-basis-point (bp) cut in key interest rates, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Eli M. Remolona Jr. signaled the possibility of two more rate cuts this year.\n“Depending on the data, we’ll cut twice more; depending on the data, we may not cut at all,” Remolona told a media briefing after the policy-setting Monetary Board (MB) decided to reduce the policy rate to 5.25 percent, from 5.5 percent previously, on June 19, Thursday.\nOn balance, the MB “sees the need for a more accommodative monetary policy stance,” the Governor said, adding that “emerging risks to inflation from rising geopolitical tensions and external policy uncertainty require closer monitoring.”\nPrior to this hint, Remolona said the BSP could proceed with trimming the rate “once more, if things remain on track.” He noted that for now, “things remain on track,” so at least a quarter-point cut is expected for the remainder of 2025. \nAs for the latest reduction, Remolona said the MB also “noted indications of a deceleration in global economic activity, driven primarily by uncertainty over US [United States] trade policy and the conflict in the Middle East.”\n“This would lead to slower growth in the Philippines. A rise in oil prices, electricity rate adjustments, and higher rice tariffs, would add to inflationary pressures,” he explained.\nSince the kick-off of the policy easing cycle in August last year, a total of 125 bps has been slashed from 6.5 percent before the rate-cutting.\nAlongside the key borrowing cost, the MB also adjusted the overnight deposit rate to 4.75 percent from five percent previously, and the lending facility rate to 5.75 percent from six percent.\nAccording to Remolona, the continued easing by the MB was driven by the favorable outlook for movements in consumer goods prices. May’s 1.3-percent headline inflation rate, the latest data available, was the lowest in nearly six years, or since late 2019.\nAs such, the BSP has revised its inflation forecast for 2025 to 1.6 percent from 2.4 percent previously. But it also raised its forecasts for 2026 to 3.4 percent from 3.3 percent, and for 2027 to 3.3 percent from 3.2 percent.\nCapital Economics senior Asia economist Gareth Leather said in a commentary that the think tank is expecting two more 25- bp cuts before the end of 2025, bringing the policy rate down to 4.75 percent.\n“Low inflation and falling interest rates will provide some support to demand this year. But with fiscal policy being tightened and exports set to weaken, we expect growth to struggle,” Leather said.\nLeather noted that the BSP Governor “alluded to the risks to inflation from higher oil prices, but...prices would need to rise to around $100 per barrel for there to be a noticeable impact on inflation.”\nGross domestic product (GDP) growth in the first quarter of 2025 stood at 5.4 percent, a bit faster than the previous quarter, but weaker than the 5.7 percent in the same period last year.	"\\tImages/bsp-chief-remolona-twice-more-interest-rate-cuts-depending-on-economic-data-after-june-19-easing_1.png"	BSP Governor Remolona hinted at two more interest rate cuts this year, depending on economic data.

cautious-further-bsp-easing-seen-amid-peso-slide	Cautious' further BSP easing seen amid peso slide	While the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) sees no need just yet to defend the Philippine peso amid global oil price risks, the plunging local currency may push monetary authorities into more cautious policy easing moving forward, economists said.\nJapanese financial giant MUFG Bank Ltd. said that the BSP would likely kick-off an aggressive intervention to the foreign exchange (forex) rate if the peso continues to abruptly weaken to the ₱59:$1 level, as the central bank is concerned of the pass-through effect of currency depreciation.\n“We think there’s a good chance the BSP will start to intervene more aggressively if Philippine peso weakness continues unabated towards the ₱58-₱59 levels within a short space of time,” MUFG Global Markets Research senior currency analyst Michael Wan said in a commentary published on Friday, June 20.\nThis came after BSP Governor Eli M. Remolona Jr. earlier asserted that aggressively intervening only to maintain the United States (US) dollar-peso exchange rate is “futile.” But he followed it with an assurance that if the massive peso devaluation prolongs, the central bank might step in.\nAs of Thursday, June 19, the market continued to witness further decline in the value of the peso against the “safe haven” US dollar, falling to ₱57.45:$1 from ₱55 levels a week ago. This downward trend for the local currency—a 1.7-percent drop since it began falling—was first seen on Friday last week, following Israel’s airstrikes on Iran.\nDespite this trend, the Tokyo-based bank believes that peso would still strengthen at trade to ₱54.5 against the greenback by the end of 2025, driven by its “expectations of a weaker US dollar, coupled with domestic positives such as the surge in FDI [foreign direct investment] approvals, and lower domestic rice prices and manageable inflation.”\nMeanwhile, think tank Oxford Economics said that “while the BSP does not explicitly use the policy rate to influence the exchange rate, the pass-through effect of a weaker peso on inflation remains a concern.”\nPass-through refers to a massive peso drop that results in a price hike in consumer prices. Pass-through now is “very different” from before, Remolona earlier said.\nAs such, Oxford Economics lead economist Sunny Liu believes that the central bank is “likely to adopt a more cautious approach while maintaining an easing bias. We expect the next 25-bp [basis point] rate cut to take place in the fourth quarter.”\nAs expected by the market, the BSP on Thursday reduced the key interest rate by a quarter point to 5.25 percent from 5.5 percent previously. Remolona hinted that the central bank may proceed to cutting “twice more” or not at all depending on the incoming economic data.\nFor now, Remolona sees that “things are on track,” a sign that BSP may deliver another 25-bp cut by year-end.\nThe latest cut decided by the policy-setting Monetary Board (MB) had taken into account the moderation in the global economy due to the US-imposed trade policy and the escalating conflict in the Middle East.\nRemolona said that these external developments would drag growth in the Philippines, asserting in particular that “a rise in oil prices, electricity rate adjustments, and higher rice tariffs, would add to inflationary pressures.”\nIt does not help inflation expectations that, as Oxford Economics pointed out, “the Philippines is heavily reliant on fuel imports.”\nThe think tank had projected a worst-case scenario that world oil prices could jump to $120 per barrel by the third quarter. As tensions between Israel and Iran intensify, Brent crude currently trades at about $77 per barrel, climbing from $64 per barrel in May, it noted.\nAs for MUFG, its estimates “suggest that every $10 per barrel rise in oil prices boosts the Philippines’ current account deficit by 0.4 percent of GDP [gross domestic product],” putting pressure on the peso.\n“With the Philippines current account deficit already quite large at 3.5 percent of GDP in 2025 due to infrastructure and capital goods import needs, this deficit could easily rise above four percent of GDP if oil prices were to rise further, with the change at the margin being the external oil price shock, and as such making it more difficult to finance the current account deficit even with our expectation of FDI increases,” MUFG warned.\nNonetheless, MUFG believes that “from a policy rate perspective, we think that the BSP continues to be biased towards rate cuts at current oil price levels.”\nAs such, the Japanese bank expects the BSP to reduce interest rates by 50 more bps, even as the central bank “could be more constrained if oil prices rise closer to $90 per barrel and also coupled with sharp Philippine peso depreciation.”\n“Our estimates suggest that every $10-per-barrel rise in oil prices boosts inflation in the Philippines directly by around 0.6 percentage point (ppt), with inflation likely to average about 3.5 percent with oil at $90 per barrel,” MUFG said.\nSingapore-based United Overseas Bank (UOB) has a more dovish policy outlook, standing by its previous forecasts of two additional cuts in the second half of the year.\n“While economic growth and inflation prospects remain subject to downside risks particularly due to tariff uncertainty and geopolitical tensions, we keep our BSP rate forecasts for now,” UOB senior economist Julia Goh and economist Loke Siew Ting said in a June 19 commentary.\nIf realized, these anticipated reductions would bring the policy rate down to 4.75 percent. This would also translate to a 1.75-percent cumulative cut since the central bank began its easing cycle in August last year.\nThe MB has three meetings left this year—scheduled for Aug. 28, Oct. 9, and Dec. 11.\nBut the UOB economists pointed to “some changes in the [monetary policy decision] statement that indicate the BSP is likely on a more moderate easing pace going into the second half of 2025.”\nFor instance, the central bank “added for the first time in the statement that the MB will also continue to assess the impact of prior monetary policy adjustments,” UOB noted.\n“During post-meeting briefing, the BSP Governor highlighted that inflation remains the central bank’s priority in deciding future monetary policy stance,” it added.\nStill, “higher positive real interest rates, which are at an almost 10-year high, also indicate that the central bank has plenty of room to ease in the near term despite a narrowing interest rate differential with US rates,” the Singaporean bank said.	"\\tImages/cautious-further-bsp-easing-seen-amid-peso-slide_1.png"	The Philippine peso's decline may lead to a more cautious approach to monetary easing by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP).  Economists predict the BSP will intervene if the peso weakens to ₱58-₱59:$1, concerned about the impact on inflation.  While the BSP recently cut interest rates, further cuts depend on incoming economic data and global oil prices. Rising oil prices pose a significant threat to the Philippine economy, potentially increasing inflation and the current account deficit.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/20/cautious-further-bsp-easing-seen-amid-peso-slide

bsp-chief-warns-inflation-could-top-5-amid-oil-peso-woes	BSP chief warns inflation could top 5% amid oil, peso woes	Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Eli M. Remolona Jr. warned that rising global oil prices and the peso’s depreciation streak could push inflation above five percent, a level last seen nearly two years ago.\n“We do scenario analysis today [Friday] in which we focus on particular risks. Oil is one of the big risks that we worry about. We have a bad scenario, if I may call it that, in which our inflation rate could exceed five percent,” Remola said in a OneNews interview on Friday, June 20.\n“But we hope it doesn’t happen and we’re carefully watching that,” he added.\nThe last time inflation accelerated faster than five percent was in September 2023, when it posted a 6.1 percent rate. It then gradually declined throughout the year until May 2025, when it clocked in at 1.3 percent — its slowest in nearly six years since November 2019.\nRemolona cited the combination of rising Dubai crude oil prices and the sharp devaluation of the local currency as the major contributors to a spike in consumer prices.\nFor oil prices, the BSP governor said “There is a risk that the Strait of Hormuz will be closed. That would be a big risk.” The Strait of Hormuz is one of the world’s major shipping routes and the only waterway connecting the Persian Gulf to the open sea.\nClosing the passage, Remolona said, “would mean much higher oil prices, and that would mean higher inflation in the Philippines. So those are the big risks that we worry about.”\nRemolona earlier said that some of the major factors considered in the latest decision to trim the key borrowing costs by a quarter point to 5.25 percent were the slowdown in the global economy due to the tariff-led trade policies by the United States (US) and the mounting tensions between Israel and Iran.\nHe said these developments could slow the Philippine economic activity, adding that hikes in oil prices, electricity rates, coupled with higher rice tariffs, “would add to inflationary pressures.”\nAccording to Remolona, if the bad scenario does not push through, the policy-setting Monetary Board (MB) could continue shaving off another 25 basis points (bps).\n“What we need to see is for the bad scenario not to materialize. If things are going the way they’ve been going, I think we can continue to cut,” Remolona said.\nMeanwhile, Dutch financial giant ING expects two additional quarter-point cuts by year‑end, bringing rates down to 4.75 percent from the latest rate of 5.25 percent. Further cuts would be driven by “a lower-than-expected inflation trajectory and downside risks to domestic growth.”\nRemolona said that while local gross domestic product (GDP) growth “remains robust, I think it's not as strong as it could be,” noting that this was among the reasons the central bank decided to further slash rates.\nIf realized, ING’s quarter-point cut prediction would result in a total of 175 bps in cuts since the policy easing began in August last year.\n“However, risks are currently skewed towards fewer rate cuts given the Philippines’ vulnerability to higher oil prices,” said Deepali Bhargava, regional head of research at ING Asia-Pacific.\nBhargava added that tariff-related concerns, which escalated quickly after the comeback of US President Donal Trump in power, is expected to be dragged through the third quarter. The three-month pause the US imposed across the board is set to end by early July.\nThis, alongside the ongoing global tensions, is expected to result in a more cautious approach of the BSP to cutting rates.

The BSP governor cited the Strait of Hormuz closure risk as a major factor in potentially higher oil prices and inflation.

ING predicts further rate cuts, but risks remain due to the Philippines' oil price vulnerability and global tensions.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/20/bsp-chief-warns-inflation-could-top-5-amid-oil-peso-woes
boc-intensifies-fight-against-fuel-smuggling-seizes-2195-million	BOC intensifies fight against fuel smuggling, seizes ₱219.5 million	The Bureau of Customs (BOC) intercepted ₱219.5 million worth of smuggled fuel at the La Union Port on Thursday, June 19, 2025, effectively disrupting an illegal fuel transfer operation.\nIn a statement, Customs Commissioner Bienvenido Y. Rubio said the bureau needs to intensify operations against the illicit entry of unmarked fuel into the country due to its significant economic impact and the serious hazards it poses to consumers.\nThe operation was a joint effort by the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Services-Manila International Container Port (CIIS-MICP), along with the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) Task Force Aduana and the National Bureau of Investigation-Organized and Transnational Crime Division (NBI-OTCD). Intelligence and enforcement operations were initiated following reports about the paihi modus, which involves the illegal transfer of fuel.\nBOC-CIIS Director Verne Enciso noted that the composite team apprehended the motor tanker Bernadette in the act of conducting the paihi.\nThe MT Bernadette was in the process of transferring diesel fuels to a lorry truck when our team apprehended them at around 9:45 in the evening of June 19. Two lorry trucks were found containing diesel fuel from the motor tanker, he said.\nAn initial inventory conducted on June 20, 2025, revealed that the motor tanker was loaded with approximately 200,000 liters of diesel fuel. The two lorry trucks contained 19,000 liters and 40,000 liters of diesel fuel, respectively, bringing the total seized to about 259,000 liters of diesel fuel.\nAt the time of their apprehension, the 10 crew members of MT Bernadette were unable to provide documents to prove the legality of their activity.\nIn addition to the crew, 11 other individuals identified as drivers, porters, lookouts, and accomplices were apprehended, bringing the total number of individuals caught to 21.\nThe NBI-OTCD team immediately began processing the crew, drivers, and other accomplices for inquest proceedings. Members of the Philippine Army Security and Escort Battalion also arrived to provide additional security during the operation.\nCustoms Deputy Commissioner for Intelligence Group Juvymax Uy lauded the operation and assured that those involved would face the full extent of the law.\nThe continued vigilance of our officers led to this crucial operation. We commend every step taken to stop these illegal activities because these interceptions bring us closer to putting an end to these criminal networks and limiting their capabilities to repeat these activities, he added.\nThe owners, ship captain, and crew of the seized vessel and lorry trucks, as well as the owner of the seized diesel fuel, will face administrative and criminal charges. These charges are for violations of Sections 117, 1113, and 1401 of Republic Act No. 10863, also known as the Customs Modernization and Tariff Act (CMTA), and RA 10963, or the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) Law.

gasoline-may-go-up-in-the-first-week-of-june	Gasoline may go up in the first week of June	Mixed price movements in the gas pumps are expected in the first week of June.\nBased on the four-day Mean of Platts Singapore (MOPS), gasoline prices may either retain their current price or increase by up to ₱0.40 per liter.\nDiesel, on the other hand, is seeing an uncertain adjustment, as it could potentially have a ₱0.20 per liter rollback or increase by up to ₱0.40.\nKerosene is also set to decrease by ₱0.10 per liter.\nAccording to the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Oil Industry Management Bureau (OIMB), next week’s price movements are affected by the European Union’s (EU) trade deal with the United States (US).\nEarlier this week, the EU was pursuing trade talks with the US to lessen the 50 percent tariff on imported goods.\nWhile this negotiation is in development, Rodela Romero, OIMB director, mentioned that there would be potential new US sanctions on Russia, while geopolitical tensions continue in oil-producing countries.\nHowever, the rollbacks could be attributed to OPEC+’s plans of increasing oil production, as well as the “economic slowdown, particularly in Asia, and shifting energy priorities in countries like India, thus contributing to the reduced demand forecasts.”\nJetti Petroleum also noted that there has been progress between the US and Iran.\n“[The] Iran and the US delegations made progress in their talks, concerns of tighter supply after the US barred the export of Venezuelan crude oil have pushed the benchmarks higher,” said Leo Bellas, Jetti Petroleum president.\n“Prices also found support on possible new sanctions on Russia, decision by the US to extend the trade deal talks with the European Union, decline in US crude and fuels stockpiles, and the US court ruling on tariffs,” he added.\nRefinery maintenance is nearing its completion, which will further contribute to the price movements in the first week of June, however, Bellas added that the rise of demand in gasoline could potentially drive prices higher due to summer demand.	"\\tImages/gasoline-may-go-up-in-the-first-week-of-june_1.png"	Gasoline prices may increase by up to ₱0.40 per liter in the first week of June, while diesel prices are uncertain and kerosene is set to decrease.  The price movements are influenced by the EU-US trade deal, potential US sanctions on Russia, and OPEC+'s production plans.  Reduced demand and progress in US-Iran talks also play a role. Refinery maintenance nearing completion will also impact prices.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/05/30/gasoline-may-go-up-in-the-first-week-of-june

filipino-ev-firm-mober-enters-thailands-logistics-market	Filipino EV firm Mober enters Thailand's logistics market	Manila-based electric vehicle (EV) logistics firm Mober is expanding its operations to Thailand to further its regional footprint in green delivery solutions. \nIn a statement, Jade Hugo, Mober co-founder and head of new business, said the company launched its EV logistics with an initial fleet of 21 electric trucks in Bangkok's Bang Na district, primarily to support IKEA Thailand's last-mile delivery needs. \nTo support this deployment, Mober has built a 1,600-square-meter charging hub in Bang Na, equipped with four 22-kW chargers and two 60-kW fast chargers. This facility is expected to optimize turnaround and enable 150 to 200 deliveries per day. \nHugo said that they are proud to bring their proven green logistics solutions from the Philippines to Thailand, noting it as a market with a thriving environment for EVs. \nHe added that they are confident they will not only make deliveries in Thailand greener but also contribute to a more sustainable urban environment.\nThis expansion follows other recent initiatives for Mober in 2025. In February, the company introduced the Philippines' first 100 percent electric tractor head truck for large-scale logistics. The following month saw the opening of the Philippines' largest commercial EV charging hub, a 3,000-square-meter facility with a 56-port capacity. \nDennis Ng, Mober chief executitive officer, said that this expansion fulfills the company’s goal of bringing sustainable logistics from the Philippines to the region. \nHe added that this move is about introducing their EVs in Thailand and continuously building the foundation for sustainable and efficient urban delivery in the region.\nMober's entry into Thailand is supported by ongoing investments in green logistics. The company is also raising additional funding to support its Philippine operations and scale its EV fleet in Thailand, with growth in the number of units planned by early 2026.

doe-to-launch-enhanced-3rd-microgrid-csp-covering-167-underserved-areas	DOE to launch enhanced 3rd microgrid CSP covering 167 underserved areas	The Department of Energy (DOE) is gearing up for the third round of the Competitive Selection Process (CSP) for Microgrid System Providers (MGSPs), with refined policies and regulations aimed at ensuring more transparent, efficient, and investor-attractive microgrid operations.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, May 27, the DOE announced it would reveal the schedule for this enhanced third CSP by June, following the effectivity of the revised implementing rules and regulations (IRR) of the Microgrid Systems Act last May 13.\nThe 3rd CSP will initially cover 71 lots, encompassing 167 unserved and underserved areas nationwide. The promulgated IRR have streamlined CSP procedures, clarified provisions of the microgrid service contract and the responsibilities of stakeholders, and improved incentives for the provision of microgrid services.\nAccording to the DOE, the awarding of a microgrid service area to a provider automatically designates the project as an Energy Project of National Significance (EPNS) under the revised IRR. This EPNS status ensures priority processing and swift agency approvals for the project.\n“In addition, the notice of award will include a Renewable Energy Service Contract (RESC) for the RE components of the microgrid system, subject to the completion of remaining requirements, particularly the submission of proof of possessory rights over the service area,” the DOE added.\nFurthermore, the DOE also highlighted flexible contractual terms and exemptions from certain financial obligations, which will be detailed in the notice of award and formalized in the Microgrid System Provider Service Contract with the National Power Corporation (NPC).\nEnergy Undersecretary Rowena Guevara said that this third CSP for MGSPs would help increase total electrification.\n“By streamlining regulatory procedures, introducing policy innovations, and strengthening coordination across government and the private sector, we are sending a clear signal: the Philippines is ready and open for sustainable microgrid investments. Through these efforts, we aim to empower our most remote communities with clean, reliable, and affordable energy, because energy access is not just a policy objective—it is a fundamental right,” she said.

energy-projects-unlikely-to-stall-despite-doe-leadership-change-mvp	Energy projects unlikely to stall despite DOE leadership change—MVP	Businessman Manuel V. Pangilinan, chairman and chief executive officer of the country’s largest power distributor, Manila Electric Company (Meralco), hopes President Marcos will appoint a capable successor to outgoing Energy Secretary Raphael P.M. Lotilla.\nOn the sidelines of Meralco’s Annual Stockholders Meeting on Tuesday, May 27, Pangilinan said that Lotilla’s unexpected departure from the Department of Energy (DOE) would not lead to delays in ongoing energy projects and programs.\nPresident Marcos recently reassigned Lotilla to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) as part of a Cabinet reshuffle announced by Malacañang last week. This move saw Lotilla replace Maria Antonia Yulo-Loyzaga as the new DENR chief.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhen asked by reporters if the change in DOE leadership would stall the country’s energy initiatives, Pangilinan responded, “I don’t think so.”\n“I think Secretary Lotilla has laid out his own plans, and there should be good ones. So, I doubt whether the successor will deviate much from what is laid out. He’s a very competent public servant, so I doubt the successor would make substantial changes,” Pangilinan noted.\nWhile President Marcos has yet to name the next DOE Secretary, Energy Undersecretary Sharon S. Garin will take over as the officer-in-charge (OIC).\nRonnie L. Aperocho, Meralco executive vice-president and chief operating officer, expressed optimism that Garin would help advance the country’s nuclear energy ambitions.\n“She’s on top of the nuclear agenda. Though we have not discussed it yet, we believe that [this] will be on top of their agenda,” Aperocho said, referring to the Philippine Atomic Energy Regulatory Authority (PhilAtom) bill currently awaiting progress in the Senate.\nThe PhilAtom bill aims to establish a regulatory body for nuclear developments, ensuring safety and security standards, and providing licensing and oversight for nuclear facilities.

da-boc-nab-90-million-worth-of-smuggled-sugar-tobacco-at-manila-port	DA, BOC nab ₱90 million worth of smuggled sugar, tobacco at Manila port	Approximately ₱90 million worth of smuggled sugar and cigarettes were seized by authorities at the Port of Manila, further fueling the government’s ongoing crackdown on agricultural smuggling to protect farmers and consumers.\nOfficials from the Department of Agriculture (DA) and the Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) on Thursday, May 29, inspected the smuggled goods earlier flagged by the Bureau of Customs (BOC).\nThe BOC confiscated four container vans loaded with a total of 2,000 50-kilo bags of sugar, with an estimated retail value of ₱9 million.\nTwo of the shipments, which arrived on April 29 from Thailand, carried refined sugar imported by Roxas City-based Lapaz Multi-purpose Cooperative (LMC).\nAccording to the DA, LMC allegedly did so without any permit or import allocation from the SRA. It also does not have the clearance to release imported sugar.\nMeanwhile, the two other container vans, which arrived in January from Vietnam, also imported refined sugar but were originally declared as sweetener mix.\nIf the cargo were allowed to go through, the government would have been deprived of ₱1.8 million in import tax since the sweetener mix has lower tariffs.\nThe DA said the shipment has been declared abandoned by Yabai OPC, the consignee on record.\nBOC Commissioner Bienvenido Rubio stated that the two consignees will face charges for violating the Anti-Agricultural Economic Sabotage Act, specifically for importing agricultural goods without clearance and for misclassification.\n“I'm sure matatakot na talaga yung mga smugglers na yan especially with the law, anti-agri-smuggling na talagang pwedeng makulong sila without bail,” said Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel in an interview.\n(I'm sure those smugglers will be scared now, especially with the anti-agricultural smuggling law that can actually have them jailed without bail.)\nLaurel has since instructed the SRA to blacklist LMC and Yobai, who are both registered sugar traders and importers.\nSince the intensified crackdown against agricultural smuggling began last year, over 20 local firms have been blacklisted.\nThe smuggled sugar is now undergoing tests by the SRA to verify if they are fit for human consumption to potentially distribute to the public.\nLaurel said two of the shipments are still being assessed, however the other two were already found to have traces of mesophilic bacteria.\nSRA Administrator Pablo Luis Azcona said laboratory tests revealed that the sugar have a microbial load of 3,775 CFU (colony forming units) per 10 grams, which is higher than the safe standard of 200 CFU per 10 grams.\nEssentially, this indicates that the products are not fit for human consumption.\nIf the other shipments were found to be safe, Laurel said it would likely be given to the public. However, he said they will still consult if this is legal under the Anti-Agricultural Economic Sabotage Act.\nCigarettes snuffed out\nAside from the sugar, the BOC also confiscated smuggled cigarettes worth approximately ₱81.06 million.\nEarlier, the BOC confiscated a container from Taiwan that was declared as fabrics, but was later found to be cigarettes.\nRubio has identified I and C KR Manufacturing Philippines Corp. as the consignee of the shipment. He said they will investigate the firm and will file appropriate charges.\n"We cannot let these illicit trading practices undermine the agriculture sector and hurt our farmers,” said Laurel, noting that consumers should relish the country’s own products instead of these smuggled goods.\nLast year, the DA’s Inspectorate and Enforcement (IE) office seized ₱2.83 billion worth of smuggled agricultural goods.\nFrom January to May 19 of this year, the DA-IE already seized and condemned smuggled goods worth a total ₱407.6 million.

employers-group-opposes-mandatory-wfh-during-edsa-rebuild	Employers group opposes mandatory WFH during EDSA 'rebuild'	The country’s largest group of employers is urging the government to allow companies to implement their own work-from-home schemes, rather than imposing an industry-wide policy, during the upcoming rehabilitation work on EDSA.\nWith the preparatory works on the EDSA rebuild set to begin next month, the Employers Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP) said the government must be swift in its response to the expected gridlock along Metro Manila’s busiest highway.\nECOP President Sergio Ortiz-Luis Jr. said the business group is agreeable to a work-from-home setup to ease the daily burden of employees from commuting, which will likely be affected by the heavy traffic.\nOrtiz-Luis said a hybrid work scheme will make it easier for employees to perform their duties, similar to what happened during the Covid-19 pandemic when workers were forced to stay in their homes as a measure to curb the spread of the virus.\nHowever, he said employers are hoping that the government won’t “get carried away” in proposing policies that would make it mandatory for all companies, even if it may not apply to their specific office setup.\n“Okay lang yan pero dapat yan walang formulang fits-all sa mga kumpanya,” said Ortiz-Luis.\n(It’s okay as long as there’s no one-size-fits-all formula covering all companies.)\n“Huwag sanang ma-e-excite masyado rin naman yung mga policymaker, mga legislator na maglagay ng regulasyon. Pabayaan natin yung mga kumpanya to determine what is good for them,” he added.\n(We hope policymakers and legislators don’t become too excited about issuing regulations. Let the companies determine what’s good for them.)\nThe ECOP president stated that mandatory implementation could cause widespread operational disruptions, potentially upending businesses.\nWhile the work-from-home scheme is in play, Ortiz-Luis said the EDSA rebuild project will nonetheless affect companies’ efficiency and costs “to some extent”.\nHe explained that the impact “should not be very bad” as most establishments strive to do their best to adjust to the rebuilding project which will take between one year and a half and two years.\nAs the first major rebuild of Metro Manila’s main thoroughfare since 1980, more than 437,000 vehicles that traverse the highway every day will be affected.\nThe Department of Transportation (DOTr) earlier projected that the entire project will have a total cost of approximately ₱8.7 billion.\nOne of the major interventions that the government will implement to help ease the traffic congestion is the odd-even scheme.\nUnder the policy, vehicles with license plates ending in odd numbers—one, three, five, seven, and nine—are prohibited in EDSA on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.\nThose with license plates ending in even numbers—zero, two, four, six, and eight—are not allowed on EDSA on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.\nThe scheme will not be enforced on Sundays.\nOrtiz-Luis said that while this may initially ease congestion along EDSA, it may eventually “backfire” by pushing the public to purchase another vehicle or motorcycle.\nHe said the influx of new wheels on the road would lead to an even greater congestion, further worsening the commuting situation for the public.	"\\tImages/employers-group-opposes-mandatory-wfh-for-edsa-rehabilitation_1.png"	The Employers Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP) opposes a mandatory work-from-home policy during the EDSA rebuild, preferring company-determined schemes.  ECOP believes a hybrid approach would ease commuting burdens, mirroring the COVID-19 response.  However, a mandatory policy could disrupt businesses.  The EDSA rebuild, costing ₱8.7 billion, will affect 437,000 daily vehicles.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/05/31/employers-group-opposes-mandatory-wfh-for-edsa-rehabilitation

doe-hopes-for-more-energy-projects-after-lotillas-exit	DOE hopes for more energy projects after Lotilla's exit	Prior to moving to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), former Energy Secretary Raphael P.M. Lotilla said that the country’s energy situation has somehow improved under his wing, even as other problems have yet to find their solutions.\nDuring his final press briefing as Department of Energy (DOE) chief last week, Lotilla explained that the country currently has 13,000 megawatts (MW) worth of committed projects between 2025 to 2028.\n“I think it’s important to recall that since President [Ferdinand Marcos Jr.] came into office, over 2,900 or almost 3,000 MW of new capacity was installed from July 2022 to February 2025. The commercial operations of 32 newly constructed generation facilities, and more than half of that installed capacity is from renewable energy (RE),” he elaborated.\n“We hope to increase the number of those committed projects… The availability of what I mentioned, which is the additional or unused liquefied natural gas (LNG) reception and regasification facilities,” Lotilla said.\nAccording to the former Energy chief, the country is utilizing 4,500 MW worth of LNG, while there are 3,500 MW worth of additional capacity.\nDuring his three-year stint at the DOE, he observed the depletion of the Malampaya gas field, which was eventually addressed through drilling activities.\n“Now, we have more regular supply from Malampaya, even though the field itself is depleting. That also explains why we are committed to ensuring the additional drilling is going to take place,” he said.\nTo recall, the DOE reported the fourth phase of movements at Malampaya, including the arrival and deployment of vessels and drilling operations.\nAside from supply concerns, Lotilla assured that the DOE remains committed to pursuing the government’s energy agenda, citing the agency’s goals to complete transmission projects.\nMoreover, recently appointed DOE Officer-in-Charge Sharon S. Garin emphasized that recent reforms in the energy sector have made the country more attractive to RE investments.\n“The first issuance of [former Secretary Lotilla] was to open up the RE to 100-percent foreign ownership direct investments. We became number two in the world as the most attractive destination for RE investments,” she said.\nGarin also noted that the DOE has contracts in the pipeline, stating that “We [will] continue the policies and reforms that Secretary Lotilla has done.”\nEnergy consumer group welcomes DOE leadership shift\nWith the recent Cabinet reset, energy consumer group ILAW welcomed the appointment of Lotilla to the DENR, emphasizing the importance of integrating clean energy leadership within environmental governance.\nAccording to ILAW, Lotilla had helped drive investor confidence via the Green Energy Auction Program (GEAP), which is a mechanism designed to promote transparency and competition in the procurement of RE capacity to developers through an open and competitive bidding.\n“ILAW remains committed to pushing for policies that put people at the center of the energy transition. We extend our support to Secretary Lotilla and to all leaders willing to work transparently and collaboratively toward a greener, more energy-secure Philippines,” it stated.	"\\tImages/doe-hopes-for-more-energy-projects-after-lotillas-exit_1.png"	Former Energy Secretary Lotilla highlighted improvements in the country's energy situation, including 13,000 MW of committed projects between 2025 and 2028 and increased renewable energy capacity.

energy-players-push-for-technologies-to-bolster-grid-resilience	Energy players push for technologies to bolster grid resilience	As the country intensifies its shift to renewable energy, a recent power outage in Europe served as a cautionary tale, with a British clean energy firm suggesting that grid infrastructure, not just renewable capacity, is key for a stable power future.\nIn an interview with Manila Bulletin, Naked Energy chief executive officer Christophe Williams explained that Europe, despite its strong focus on renewable energy (RE), has faced its share of challenges in electricity supply.\nWilliams, who also spoke at the South Summit Madrid 2025, said one of the potential factors that contributed to the recent power outage in Spain and Portugal in April was the struggling power grids.\nWhile we cannot know exactly what caused this power outage, as we're not a party to the exact details, what is for sure is that Europe as a whole has been putting too much pressure on the electricity grids to deliver net zero, he said.\nA recent report by Reuters stated that the Spanish government alleged the country’s grid operator failed to calculate the energy mix, resulting in difficulty in coping with a voltage surge.\nIt’s hardly surprising that grids are overheating across Europe. What we need to do is invest in grid-edge technologies. These are distributed RE solutions that don’t take anything from the grid,” Williams explained.\nThe technology is complementary to the power grid, as it frees up grid capacity,” he added.\nWhile Europe heavily emphasizes its green energy fleet, Williams believes the recent blackout on the Iberian Peninsula and the state of grid networks in Europe would require a significant grid upgrade.\nThe European Commission estimates €584 billion (approximately ₱36.8 trillion) needed to upgrade electricity grids to reach 2030 net zero goals, and demand for electricity is set to go through the roof — in the UK it’s set to more than double by 2050,” the Naked Energy chief said.\nNaked Energy focuses on commercial and industrial decarbonization through solar thermal and hybrid photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) technologies, which address the challenges of heat decarbonization. The company was recently presented at this year’s South Summit Madrid, a global platform co-presented by IE University for entrepreneurs, startup companies, and other businesses within various industries internationally.\nRecent local actions\nA two-nation power interruption, even in systems backed by renewables, has raised serious questions about how to prevent similar incidents in the future. In the Philippines, where power disruptions remain a persistent issue, the Spain-Portugal power disruption serves as a lesson for local energy players. It’s not just about adding more RE; this could be considered a wake-up call.\nAyala-led ACEN Corporation previously told the Manila Bulletin about the importance of scaling up battery storage, which would complement the intermittency of solar. Following this, recent developments in the Philippines’ RE integration include increased capacity and framework enhancements in the fourth round of the Green Energy Auction program (GEA-4), which would allow developers to bid for either stand-alone solar projects or integrated solar with energy storage systems (ESS). GEA-4 administers bidding for integrated ESS, specifically focusing on solar power plants with Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS).	"\\tImages/energy-players-push-for-technologies-to-bolster-grid-resilience_1.png"	Europe's recent power outage highlights the need for grid infrastructure upgrades alongside renewable energy expansion.  Investing in grid-edge technologies, distributed RE solutions that free up grid capacity, is crucial.  The Philippines, facing similar power issues, should learn from this incident and prioritize solutions beyond simply adding more renewable energy capacity.  Scaling up battery storage is seen as a key complementary technology.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/19/energy-players-push-for-technologies-to-bolster-grid-resilience
european-offshore-wind-investors-fleeing-philippines	European offshore wind investors fleeing Philippines	Offshore wind investors from Spain, the United Kingdom, as well as other European countries are already storming out of the door when it comes to their targeted investments in the Philippines’ offshore wind sector, a highly placed source has affirmed.\nThe source conveyed that “many European investors are in fact selling their offshore wind projects – and these are mainly the decision of their principals from headquarters, so this is not within the control of their in-country executives or representatives.”\nThe source noted that the major offshore wind investors divesting are Spanish and UK companies that have major service contracts for offshore wind, as well as another investor from one of the Scandinavian countries.\n“The Spanish and UK firms are hunting for white knights to bail them out; and the company from the Scandinavian country is poised to offload major shareholdings, while the local firm with current European-partners is scouting for fresh joint venture for it to stay in the race,” the source stressed.\nThe industry insider further noted that “the other company that is selling is Asia-based; and its portfolio is not just offshore wind, but it also has investments in the solar industry.”\nWhen asked on the identities of the companies, the source refused to name them at this point, although emphasizing that “everyone in the Philippine offshore wind circle knows these players because they’re openly hunting for buyers,” adding that the investor in the Scandinavian country, in particular, has separate partnership in the country for its other renewable energy (RE) investments – mainly in hydro; “but it’s the offshore wind portfolio that it is intending to unload.”\nThe source highlighted that “for now, it’s the Danish companies that are still holding the line when it comes to their offshore wind ambitions in the country, but unfortunately for the others, they are already gearing for an exodus.”\nFor the UK investor, the source hinted that the company is affiliated with another player in the floating solar segment – and both of them are under the arsenal of the green investment platform of a global financial services powerhouse.\nAlthough the Department of Energy (DOE) already rolled out last week its planned 5th green energy auction (GEA) for fixed-bottom offshore wind, the source indicated that the foreign investors’ sell-off spree is already barreling ahead – and as it stands today, no policy salvo may already stop their targeted departure.\nThe energy department’s bid invitation calls for 3,300 megawatts (MW) of fixed-bottom offshore wind projects that are set for capacity deliveries within 2028 to 2030 timeframe.\nAs specified by the DOE, fixed-bottom offshore wind facilities had been initially selected for the slated auction round “due to its established global track record, cost-efficiency, and scalability.”\nThe energy department added “this approach positions the DOE to expedite the near-term deployment of offshore wind, supporting large-scale and reliable renewable energy generation aligned with the country's energy security and climate objectives.”\nUntil recently, however, there is still no marine spatial planning (MSP) that will guide investors on the ‘no go zones’, leaving industry players sailing blind through waves of uncertainty on how they will navigate some terrains of their project-sites.\nOn top of that, investors are apprehensive over the scale of tariffs that will eventually be set for offshore wind in the tender package; while the banks are still battling through the financial jungle for such type of emerging technology installations in the RE sector.	"\\tImages/european-offshore-wind-investors-fleeing-philippines_1.png"	European investors are withdrawing from Philippine offshore wind projects, primarily due to decisions made at their headquarters.  Spanish and UK companies, along with a Scandinavian firm, are actively seeking buyers for their investments.  The lack of marine spatial planning and uncertainty over tariffs contribute to investor apprehension.  Danish companies remain committed, but a mass exodus is underway despite a recent green energy auction.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/18/european-offshore-wind-investors-fleeing-philippines
doe-flexes-philippine-energy-efficiency-wins-with-global-peers	DOE flexes Philippine energy efficiency wins with global peers	BRUSSELS, Belgium – The energy efficiency playbook of the Philippines is no longer just a local script, but it is a game plan already catching global attention, with the Department of Energy (DOE) flexing to the world the execution of policies that warranted the country’s initial gains on its energy-saving reform packages.\nAt a Ministerial roundtable during the 10th Annual Global Conference on Energy Efficiency jointly hosted by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the European Commission (EC), Energy Undersecretary Felix William Fuentebella disclosed that the energy efficiency initiatives of the country already logged savings equivalent to 33 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity and 588,000 liters of fuel.\nThat in turn, according to the Philippine energy official, resulted in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions avoidance of 26 kilotonnes.\nTo pull off those energy savings, Fuentebella shared that more than $146 million of investments had been pumped into well-calculated upgrades -- including those on efficient lighting, renewable energy installations as well as retrofit of equipment.\nThe DOE official, nevertheless, acknowledged that the country’s achievement on the energy efficiency sphere is still just the tip of a colossal iceberg if compared to the full potential of the country on the whole chain of enforcement of energy efficiency ventures – with industrial efficiency across businesses breaking through as the next major battlefield the Philippines would be unleashing on its energy savings grip.\n“In the private sector, energy-intensive businesses are now required to report energy use and invest in efficiency,” he stressed, although he qualified that this is still at starting point.\nFuentebella admitted, though, that the country’s path to energy efficiency is not that easy, with several stubborn roadblocks still tripping up the country’s chase for targeted cost savings as well as reduction in energy usage.\n“We face several barriers -- limited technical expertise and funding at the local level, outdated infrastructure, and low public awareness of the long-term benefits of energy efficiency,” he noted.\nFuentebella similarly emphasized that on the domain of many business owners, they still cling to the perception that weaving energy efficiency across the chain of their operations is “risky or costly.”\nBeyond driving wins in the private sector, the energy official said there would also be core focus on shaving energy usage within government agencies through the institutionalized Government Energy Management Program (GEMP) -- which will not only cover national government agencies, state-run corporations as well as colleges and universities, but critically, the energy-hungry frontline of local government units (LGUs).\n“We are implementing the LGU Energy Code, which integrates energy efficiency into local development planning by incorporating energy infrastructure into LGUs’ land use and development plans, guided by designated energy efficiency officers,” Fuentebella specified.\nIn this year’s global energy efficiency conference, that had been attended by more than 100 countries, the spotlight was locked onto industrial efficiency as a major strategy to double the global average annual rate of energy efficiency improvements by 2030.\nIEA Executive Director Fatijh Birol asserted that “energy efficiency is about so much more than just energy. It delivers clear benefits for people, lowering their bills, improving businesses’ competitiveness and creating jobs.”\nHowever, last week’s IEA threw a wrench in the momentum, as it highlighted that industrial energy efficiency somehow hit a wall, and that prompted ministers and business leaders to dissect “how digital technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), can help optimize operations and reduce consumption.”\nApart from energy efficiency rollout within the league of big businesses, global policy leaders are likewise tightening the screws by exploring other effective policies “to unlock investment and improve affordability and competitiveness – especially for small businesses and low-income households.”\nOn top of that, buildings and appliances will similarly be in focus, with the IEA expounding that “policymakers (are) discussing how to expand building codes, retrofit existing stock, and raise efficiency standards for fast-growing product categories such as air conditioners,” citing further that to-date, “five air conditioners are sold globally every second, but most are only half as efficient as the best available models.”	"\\tImages/doe-flexes-philippine-energy-efficiency-wins-with-global-peers_1.png"	The Philippines' energy efficiency initiatives have yielded significant savings, including 33 gigawatt-hours of electricity and a reduction in CO2 emissions.  These savings resulted from over \\$146 million in investments.  However, challenges remain, including limited expertise and funding, outdated infrastructure, and overcoming business perceptions of high risk and cost. The DOE plans to expand efforts to the private sector and government agencies, aiming to further reduce energy consumption.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/19/doe-flexes-philippine-energy-efficiency-wins-with-global-peers
fgen-chief-calls-for-policy-reforms-to-boost-re-investments	FGen chief calls for policy reforms to boost RE investments	Lopez-led First Gen Corporation (FGen) is hoping for proactive reforms in the country’s current power policies to help encourage investors to push for renewable energy (RE). During the Annual Stockholders Meeting on Thursday, May 29, FGen President Francis Giles Puno said that certain regulations pose challenges to power investments, as he shared suggestions for the energy sector to help address these issues. “In recent years, we have faced an increasingly challenging power situation. The country’s dwindling reserves are symptomatic of aging power plants struggling to respond to drastically increasing power demand,” he said in his keynote speech. Stronger government support, according to the FGen chief, would benefit major RE technologies such as geothermal, hydropower, and liquefied natural gas (LNG), while an improved competitive selection process (CSP) would offer balanced commercial terms to power generators and investors. Puno also pointed out that residential consumers could greatly benefit from being included in the Retail Competition and Open Access (RCOA) program, as it would allow them to choose their own electricity provider. He also hoped that the coal moratorium, which halts certain coal-fired power projects from operations, will “reverse the concerning trend of coal exceeding over 60 percent of our power mix from coal supply that is substantially imported from countries such as Indonesia and Australia.” “In recent years, we have faced an increasingly challenging power situation. The country’s dwindling reserves are symptomatic of aging power plants struggling to respond to drastically increasing power demand. This increase in power demand is largely caused by intensifying heat and rapidly growing economic activity. Each year, the urgency to address capacity issues has become more and more pronounced. These are not business issues, but extremely important national issues which require the need for stronger, more collaborative partnership. We look forward to this elevated collaboration,” he elaborated. He also highlighted the need to re-evaluate market price caps, which limit electricity rates that affect power generators’ profits, which in turn, makes investors hesitant to fund their projects. “In an ideal world, they [market price caps] can be removed, but then, they [government or regulator] can also adjust it so that you allow generators to make money, because it’s merchant. It’s not running every day,” he told reporters in an ambush interview. “Merchant financing becomes very problematic because even the market mechanisms are not rewarding you for the risk that you are taking.” FGen’s chief financial officer Emmanuel Singson added that the company’s capital expenditures (CAPEX) is worth about US$601 million or approximately ₱33 billion. “Ninety percent is actually for the Energy Development Corp. (EDC), so geothermal, for the drilling, [the] batteries,” he cited.

factory-gate-price-growth-weakens-in-april-amid-electronics-slowdown	Factory gate price growth weakens in April amid electronics slowdown	Factory gate price growth slowed further in April, driven mainly by weaker output in the computer, electronic, and optical products sector, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA).\nPreliminary data from the PSA revealed that the producer price index (PPI), which reflects the year-on-year increase in prices of manufactured goods, slowed further by 0.1 percent in April from the previous month’s 0.6 percent growth in price increase.\nThis lower producer’s inflation also reversed the slight deflation of 0.7 percent in April of last year.\nAccording to the PSA, the production of “computer, electronic and optical products industry division” was the main driver of the deceleration of the annual rate of PPI for manufactured goods.\nThe growth rate of the manufacture of computer, electronic, and optical products industry division declined by 1.3 percent in April from 0.9 percent annual increase in March 2025.\nThis division contributed 59.3 percent to the slower annual growth rate of the factory gate price hike during the month. Among the 22 industry divisions for manufacturing, this division holds the second-highest weight in calculating the index.\nOther major contributors to the slower annual producers’ inflation in April were the slowdown in the annual growth rate of the manufacture of transport equipment, which eased to 0.3 percent in April from a 1.5 percent annual hike in March.\nAside from this, there was also an annual 0.9-percent decline in the price increase in the production of basic metals, faster than March’s 0.1-percent decrease.\nMeanwhile, the production of coke and refined petroleum products was the main contributor to the overall rate of annual producers’ inflation. Joining this is the production of food products and beverages.\nFactory gate prices for food products accelerated by 0.9 percent year-on-year in April, up from 0.4 percent in March. This was also higher than the 0.5-percent increase recorded in April last year.\nHigher growth rates mainly drove this in seven out of eight industry groups. Leading the increase was the dairy products sector, which posted a 2.5 percent annual growth, up from 1.2 percent in March.

from-tax-reform-to-tech-reform-karl-chuas-data-driven-mission-at-ayala	From tax reform to tech reform: Karl Chua's data-driven mission at Ayala	Previously dubbed as the “poster boy of tax reform” for spearheading the Philippines’ most significant fiscal overhaul in decades, Karl Kendrick Chua is now championing another kind of transformation—this time at the intersection of data, artificial intelligence (AI), and innovation.\nAs a former Department of Finance (DOF) undersecretary—and later the country’s chief economist as the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Secretary during one of its most trying moments, the Covid-19 pandemic—Chua earned national acclaim for architecting a series of tax reform measures and market liberalization reforms that continue to bolster the Philippines’ fiscal and economic health today. Now, in his new role as managing director and group head for data science and AI at Ayala Corp., Chua is harnessing the power of data and technology to serve Filipino consumers more effectively through one of the country’s most influential business groups.\nFrom public service to private-sector impact\nFor his role in pushing for tax reforms that we enjoy to this day, Chua became synonymous with smart governance and data-driven policy. Today, his impact is channeled through a different arena—the digital corridors of Ayala, the Philippines’ oldest and most diversified conglomerate, which spans banking (Bank of the Philippine Islands), telecommunications (Globe Telecom), fintech (GCash), real estate (Ayala Land), healthcare (AC Health), energy (ACEN), logistics (AC Logistics), transport (ACMobility), and more.\nIn an interview with Manila Bulletin, Chua explained his new mission succinctly: “Bong Consing, who hired me, wanted me to help the Ayala Group become a data- and AI-driven organization,” referring to Ayala President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Cezar Consing.\nTo do this, Chua expanded Ayala Analytics—a team focused on creating the tech infrastructure, governance framework, and cultural shift required to embed data and AI into every corner of the business. “AI is a people play, not just a tech play. The tech is actually the easy part,” he noted. “Before we can become an AI-driven organization, we have to become a digitally transformed organization. And before that, we have to improve our business process.”\nHis team, while small at around 10 members plus several interns, works with over 200 active analytics professionals across the Ayala ecosystem. Together, they drive AI strategy across Ayala’s many business units—from developing a group-wide AI strategy to route optimization in logistics, customer traffic and personalization in malls and healthcare, and drone-powered monitoring and prediction in renewable energy (RE).\nHow does this help the planet?\nIn a poignant moment during a commencement address at the University of the Philippines’ (UP) National Graduate School of Engineering last year, Chua shared a question posed by his first-born son, Keid Ashby (now nine years old), after visiting his office: “Daddy, what do you do in Ayala?” Chua told him he worked on data science and AI. But then came the follow-up: “How does that exactly benefit the planet?”\nChua admitted the question stumped him. “I struggled to articulate an answer. Perhaps that is what a Miss Universe candidate feels during the ‘question and answer’ portion,” he said. Yet, the question cuts to the core of what drives his current work.\nDefend, extend, upend\nAyala’s AI strategy is organized into three progressive layers:\n- Defend: Establish the digital foundations—cybersecurity, quality data, governance protocols—necessary to deploy AI responsibly;\n- Extend: Enhance current business processes using AI tools. One example: improving the productivity of meetings by using generative AI like Microsoft Copilot to summarize discussions and identify action points; and\n- Upend: Create entirely new products or services driven by AI. GCash’s GScore, for instance, is an AI-generated credit scoring system that helps expand access to credit while maintaining low default rates.\nChua emphasized that while not all Ayala business units are ready to “upend,” all of them can at least “extend” their capabilities through AI. “Everyone has to embrace it. If the transition from manual to computer and then to the internet was difficult, this one is more difficult—but it has to be done,” he said.\nIs AI a friend or foe?\nAsked whether AI is a friend or a foe, Chua did not hesitate: “I think it is a tool that many people can use to help themselves improve, and in the process, help improve the company, and in the process, offer better products or services to the customers.”\nBut he also acknowledged the fears. “If the internet as a tool made some people very scared, AI is much bigger in scope,” he warned.\nTo address these concerns, Chua is spearheading a comprehensive reskilling and retooling effort within Ayala. His team produces a weekly AI digest, conducts technical workshops, and manages executive courses to ensure everyone—from junior staff to senior leaders—understands how AI works and how it can be ethically and effectively integrated into daily operations.\n“The job may be replaced,” Chua said candidly, “but our objective is to make sure the person doing the job has a different skill set—an AI skill set—so that he or she can do something better.”\nMaking AI work for the people\nChua’s vision goes beyond corporate performance. He sees AI as a tool to address long-standing inequalities in Filipino society.\nIn his UP speech, Chua underscored how the Covid-19 pandemic worsened disparities in education, healthcare, and income. “We cannot create a prosperous society if there is huge inequality,” he said. “While we cannot control outcome inequality, we can give every Filipino an equal opportunity to succeed.”\nHe offered tangible AI-driven solutions:\n- An app like Singapore’s LifeSG that streamlines citizen-government interactions;\n- AI-assisted route planning to make public transport more efficient;\n- Drones and sensors to help farmers increase yields and get fairer prices; and\n- Mapping cell tower coverage to ensure educational connectivity in underserved barangays.\nChua also posed Keid Ashby’s powerful question to the graduates—and to anyone working in tech: “How will your work exactly benefit the planet?”\nSmart cities, sustainability, and ethics\nAt Ayala, Chua is also helping the group’s move toward smart, sustainable cities. “Connectivity of people and information—basically roads, transport and ICT [information and communications technology]—is not great today. A smart city will integrate them better,” he said. With partners like Ayala Land, he envisions communities powered by solar energy, populated by electric vehicles (EVs), and driven by citizen data—all optimized through AI.\nBut for Chua, innovation must be tempered by responsibility. “We now have to upgrade from just thinking about data privacy and governance into AI governance,” he explained.\nAyala is working with global partners such as the National University of Singapore (NUS) and international regulatory bodies to refine its AI ethics and safeguard systems. “Doing AI is not magic. It requires solid foundations,” Chua emphasized. “If organizations are unable to do AI, chances are their foundations are not ready.”\nEducating and empowering the next generation\nChua is particularly proud of Ayala’s partnership with UP’s pioneering AI program. “There are many data science courses, but there’s only one AI program—and that is in the UP College of Engineering,” he said.\nAyala supports this through internships, scholarships, and faculty research collaborations, offering real-world exposure to students while tapping into fresh talent for national development. “We also commission nation-building projects that don’t benefit Ayala directly, but benefit the country broadly,” he added.\nFrom reform to revolution\nDespite having moved into corporate life, Chua remains guided by public purpose. “Our purpose is something bigger—how do we become better in what we do and what we offer to our customers through better use of data?”\nHe closed his UP address with a call for courage and integrity, quoting Theodore Roosevelt’s famed “Man in the Arena” speech. “The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena… who strives valiantly… who errs… but who does actually strive to do the deeds.”\nIn Chua’s case, the arena has changed—from the halls of Congress to the boardroom, from tax codes to algorithms—but his fight remains the same: building a more inclusive, innovative, and intelligent future for the Filipino people.\nFrom shaping public policy to driving digital progress, the Ayala executive’s work reflects a rare blend of visionary leadership, technical expertise, and nation-building ethos.

first-gen-seeks-erc-directive-on-santa-rita-plant-ppa-extension-with-meralco	First Gen seeks ERC directive on Santa Rita plant PPA extension with Meralco	Lopez-led First Gen Corporation, via its subsidiary First Gas Power Corporation, is seeking approval from the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) for the extension of its power purchase agreement (PPA) with the Manila Electric Company (Meralco) covering its 1,000-megawatt Santa Rita gas-fired plant, situated in Batangas.\nIn a May 22, 2025 letter to the ERC obtained by the Manila Bulletin, the Lopez firm sought that “the PPA may be extended without the conduct of a CSP (competitive selection process)”, pursuant to Article 2.2 of the PPA that was signed between First Gas and Meralco on Jan. 9, 1997.\nFirst Gas reckoned that the power supply deal extension for its Santa Rita plant gas plant could be excluded from the CSP exercise or the auction of power supply agreements (PSAs) by distribution utilities (DUs) because that specified PPA secured regulatory approval way back in 1997, which was long before the enforcement of the CSP policy by the Department of Energy (DOE) and that the mandate of the Supreme Court (SC) ruling on supply contracts requiring CSP for PSAs cover only the PSA applications that had been submitted to the ERC “on or after June 30, 2015.”\nArticle 2.2 (c) of the First Gas-Meralco PPA for the Santa Rita plant stipulated that: “the initial term, as extended pursuant to Section 2.2 (b) may be extended for up to three (3) additional periods of five (5) years each, provided that Meralco or seller requests an extension of (the) agreement not less than two (2) years nor more than three (3) years prior to the initial expiration of the term – in the case of the first extension; and not less than two (2) years nor more than three (3) years prior to each subsequent expiration of the term – in the case of all subsequent extensions.”\nThe PPA further provided that “if either Meralco or seller requests an extension of the term, the parties shall promptly enter into good faith negotiations to reach an extension agreement on terms and conditions acceptable to each party.”\nThe Santa Rita PPA will lapse on Aug. 17, 2025; and First Gas wrote to Meralco relative to its extension bid on April 12, 2023 – more than two years ahead of the supply deal’s expiration; and it asked that their contract be stretched for additional years under the same terms and conditions under the extension clause of the original PPA.\nOn this precept, First Gas is requesting guidance and clarification from the ERC “as to whether the extension of the PPA under the same terms and conditions pursuant to its extension clause is valid and enforceable.”\nThe company primarily highlighted that in the May 2019 high court decision on the conduct of mandatory CSP by the DUs, “the lack of retroactive effect of the ruling to PSAs executed prior to June 30, 2015 is a recognition by the Supreme Court that PSAs predating CSP regulations, including the subject PPA, remain valid and enforceable,” adding that “all the terms and conditions of PSAs entered into prior to June 30, 2015 should be respected, including the PPA.”\nThe Lopez firm conveyed that the PPA for the Santa Rita gas plant was approved by the Energy Regulatory Board (ERB), a precursor-agency of the ERC, on June 11, 1997; and the regulatory body then primarily acknowledged the project “as a pre-investment to build an entirely  new industry in natural gas,” and “it will also provide energy diversification that is critical  to the continued progress and security of the nation.”\nIn the evolution of the country’s gas sector, First Gas further stated that the propounded PPA extension shall be well-aligned with off-take contracts “enabling the implementation of the new gas sale and purchase agreement that sustains the continuity of the Malampaya project,” specifying that in the two decades of operations of the Santa Rita power facility, it has consistently drawn fuel for its electricity generation from the country’s sole commercial gas field.\nAdditionally, the power firm cited that “the respect accorded by the State to subsisting contracts is legislated in the Philippine Natural Gas Industry Development Act,” primarily under Section 43 of Republic Act No. 12120, which prescribes that “current and subsisting agreements shall remain valid and in force in accordance with the existing terms and conditions agreed to by the parties until the expiration or termination thereof.”\nThat law similarly sets forth that “it shall operationalize the mandated prioritization in Section 23 of power produced from indigenous natural gas over the conventional energy sources, which includes indigenous natural gas power supply contracting.”\nFirst Gas expounded that the Santa Rita plant has “consistently demonstrated  the flexibility to  respond to demand variability of the grid, despite being a baseload plant,” emphasizing that “the ability to respond to unpredictable fluctuations is especially important with the increasing injection of variable RE (renewable energy) supply to the grid,” which is essentially an anchor to the energy transition agenda being advanced by the Marcos administration.

The company argues the extension is permissible under the original 1997 PPA and predates CSP regulations.

The Santa Rita PPA will expire on August 17, 2025.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/02/first-gen-seeks-erc-directive-on-santa-rita-plant-ppa-extension-with-meralco
factory-output-recovers-in-april	Factory output recovers in April	The total factory output of domestic manufacturers reverted to growth in April despite a slower annual increase in food production.\nThe Philippine Statistics Authority's (PSA) monthly integrated survey of selected industries (MISSI) report for April 2025, released on Friday, June 6, showed the volume of production index (VoPI)—a proxy for factory output—rose 4.2 percent year-on-year at the start of the second quarter, reversing the two-percent decline last March.\nHowever, VoPI growth in April this year was slower than a year ago's 7.3-percent expansion.\nThe PSA said 11 out of the 21 industries covered by MISSI recorded growth in April, while the rest posted declines.\nThe best-performing industries in terms of production volume were food products, basic metals, as well as transport equipment manufacturing.\nFood production growth was faster year-on-year—at 11.2 percent in April from 7.2 percent a year ago, although slower month-on-month compared to March's 17.2 percent.\n"The deceleration in the annual growth rate of VoPI for manufacture of food products in April 2025 was brought about by the downtrend in the annual growth rates of VoPI for seven out of eight industry groups. This was led by the annual decline in the manufacture of dairy products at 1.3 percent in April 2025 from a 12.4-percent annual increase in the previous month," the PSA said.\n"Meanwhile, the VoPI for manufacture of vegetable and animal oils and fats registered a faster annual growth rate of 27 percent in April 2025 from 25 percent in the previous month," it added.\nSimilar to production volume, the value of production index (VaPI) of the country's factories also returned to growth in April via a 4.3-percent expansion, reversing March's 1.4-percent decrease, although slower than a year earlier's 6.5-percent increase.\nWhile the same three sectors led the growth in April's VaPI, basic metals manufacturing was the top performer as growth in production value climbed 17.3 percent year-on-year to reverse March's 43.8-percent drop.	"\\tImages/factory-output-recovers-in-april_1.png,Images/factory-output-recovers-in-april_2.png"	Philippine factory output saw a 4.2 percent year-on-year rise in April, recovering from March's decline.

dti-open-to-us-trade-talks-extension-amid-fast-approaching-tariff-deadline	DTI open to US trade talks extension amid fast-approaching tariff deadline	Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) Secretary Cristina Roque is open to the proposed extension of trade talks with the United States (US), as the government races to lower the reciprocal tariffs the Philippines is set to face on July 9.\nRoque expressed this sentiment on Wednesday, June 18, following her agency’s launch of a new program aimed at addressing the logistical challenges faced by small businesses.\n“An extension would be favorable. It would be okay. But, of course, if we really get the tariff lower than 10 percent, why not, right? But, again, everything is under negotiations,” Roque said in a chance interview.\nLast week, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the Trump administration could extend trade negotiations with countries that are pursuing deals in “good faith”.\nWashington is currently in talks with 17 of its major trading partners aimed at addressing US President Donald Trump’s concerns about supposedly unfair trade practices. So far, the White House has only struck a deal with the United Kingdom (UK).\nRoque did not confirm if the Philippines is among the list of countries that could soon finalize a deal with the US, citing the non-disclosure agreement (NDA) the government signed in May.\nThe DTI chief was among the key delegates from the country during its recent trade talks with the US to discuss concerns regarding the 17 percent reciprocal tariffs on Philippine goods entering the US.\nShe said then the meeting “went very well” and that the country’s assertions “were well received.”\nFast forward to June, the secretary said the government “doesn’t know yet what the decision of the US will be.”\n“Everybody's confident in or hoping to get what we negotiated for because when we went there, it seemed that their feedback was okay,” said Roque.\n“Whatever the decision is, we will definitely make everybody aware of this,” she added\nThe trade secretary earlier told reporters that goal of the meeting was to lower the tariffs slapped to the Philippines, now she remains in “high hopes” that this can be realized.\nThe government is intent on lowering the country’s tariffs to make local industries more competitive compared to neighboring Southeast Asian countries.\nThe Philippines, with its 17 percent tariffs, is among the lowest in the region, while its closest neighbors were slapped with among the highest taxes.\nCurrently, majority of the US trading partners are only slapped with a 10 percent baseline tariff, with the higher reciprocal tariffs suspended until next month.\nWhile the world awaits for the planned resumption of high levies, the DTI is looking to establish a nationwide support system to address the logistics concerns of exporters, importers, and micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs).\nUnder the so-called Supply Chain and Logistics Center (SCLC), which was launched on Wednesday, the DTI is set to provide a seamless bridge between industry players and the country’s leading logistics providers.\nThe SCLC covers a government hotline that provides real-time assistance on logistics issues, as well as a digital platform that will house relevant supply chain data and decision-making tools, among others.

emperador-leverages-smart-tech-in-spain-renewables-in-uk-for-eco-drive	Emperador leverages smart tech in Spain, renewables in UK for eco-drive	Tycoon Dr. Andrew Tan’s global spirits company Emperador Inc. (EMI) is integrating smart technologies and renewable energy (RE) initiatives into its international operations, particularly in Spain and the United Kingdom (UK), to further champion sustainability, innovation, and environment stewardship.\n“These initiatives reinforce our strong commitment to integrating sustainability and environmental stewardship across our entire value chain,” said Emperador Inc. President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Winston Co said.\nHe added that, “While we continue to pursue growth, we also aim to align our operations to help preserve natural resources and promote care for the environment in areas where we are present worldwide.”\nThese initiatives are also aligned with the sustainability commitment of Emperador’s parent company, Alliance Global Group Inc. (AGI), under its SustainAGIlity program.\nIn a statement, Emperador said subsidiary Grupo Emperador Spain (GES) is targeting to achieve sustainable production by pioneering advanced environment-friendly processes and technologies in its vineyard operations in Spain.\nThese include intelligent irrigation systems and humidity and salinity sensors to optimize grape growth and production while reducing water consumption.\nThe company is also deploying drones to efficiently monitor vineyard usage, while employing falconry as a form of natural pest control and minimize the use of chemicals.\nAs part of its carbon neutrality goals, Emperador has deployed electric forklifts to replace combustion forklifts.\nSolar panels have also been installed as the company shifts towards stronger reliance on RE. Increased recovery of essential biogases is also being done and monitored during the wastewater treatment process.\nIn the UK, the company is implementing more renewable energy programs to further advance its carbon neutrality goals.\nEmperador’s subsidiary Whyte & Mackay has replaced its traditional boiler at the Jura Distillery with a state-of-the-art biomass boiler to significantly reduce its carbon emissions by about 5,000 tons every year.\nAt the Invergordon distillery in Scotland, the company has transitioned to a 100-percent carbon-neutral energy supply powered by wood pellet RE.\nEmperador is also utilizing a bioenergy center to further process distillery co-products and create biomethane gas, which will offset about 20,900 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) by 2026.\nIn the Philippines, Emperador is extending significant efforts to reduce carbon emissions by utilizing RE sources.\nIn 2023, the company installed a two megawatt-peak (MWp) solar photovoltaic system on its glass plant, which generates about 2.5-million kilowatt-hour (kWh) of clean energy per year. This has helped reduce the company’s carbon footprint by around 1,929 metric tons (MT) of CO2e annually.\nAnother 640 kilowatt-peak (kWp) solar facility is also set to be installed in one of Emperador’s manufacturing plants, which can generate more than 800,000 kWh of RE every year. This will help further cut down the company’s carbon footprint by 593.12 MT of CO2e.

concession-extension-for-maynilad-manila-water-to-add-50-billion-to-govt-coffers	Concession extension for Maynilad, Manila Water to add ₱50 billion to gov't coffers	More than ₱50 billion in additional government revenues is expected following the approval of a 10-year extension of the concession agreements of major water service providers by the Economy and Development (ED) Council on Wednesday, June 18.\nThe ED Council, chaired by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., approved the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System’s (MWSS) request to extend the revised concession agreements of Pangilinan-led Maynilad Water Services Inc. and Razon-led Manila Water Co. Inc.—the two main water service providers.\n“The extension is expected to accelerate capital investments, minimize tariff pressures, and secure long-term water supply. It is also projected to generate additional government revenues amounting to ₱50.3 billion,” the Department of Economy, Planning, and Development (DEPDev) said in a statement.\nIt further said that the move aims to “ensure sustained access to safe, reliable, and affordable water for Metro Manila and surrounding provinces.”\nDEPDev asserted that the extension of the contract end date from July 2037 to January 2047 aligns the agreements with the legislative franchises of the two water concessionaires, as required under Republic Act (RA) Nos. 11600 and 11601.\n“Ensuring water security is fundamental to fostering economic growth and improving the quality of life for our growing population,” said Arsenio M. Balisacan, ED Council vice chairperson and the country’s socioeconomic planner.\n“By aligning the concession agreements with legislative franchises, we are promoting policy coherence and long-term investment planning in the water sector, which are essential for delivering clean, reliable, and affordable water services to millions of Filipinos,” Balisacan added.\nAside from extending the water concession agreements, the ED Council also approved two new infrastructure projects funded through official development assistance (ODA) to boost connectivity and support agricultural development.\nOne of the approved infra projects is the Department of Agriculture’s (DA) ₱27.7-billion farm-to-market bridges development program, which will build 300 climate-resilient modular steel bridges across 52 provinces in 15 regions.\nBalisacan said that by improving physical connectivity in farming and fishing communities, the program “addresses persistent infrastructure gaps that limit market access, increase post-harvest losses, and hinder rural productivity. It also aims to uplift rural incomes and improve food logistics, particularly in geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas.”\nThe second approved project is the construction of the ₱5.1-billion Liloan bridge, which will be implemented by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH).\nDEPDev said the project involves building a four-lane, 721-meter bridge that will connect Panaon island to mainland Leyte, replacing the old and deteriorating structure. It is also expected to enhance mobility and access for residents and travelers in the towns of Liloan, San Francisco, Pintuyan, and San Ricardo, while also boosting local economic activity and generating jobs in the region.

de-ocampo-retires-as-philippine-veterans-bank-chairman	De Ocampo retires as Philippine Veterans Bank chairman	Former Finance Secretary Dr. Roberto F. de Ocampo is retiring as Chairman of Philippine Veterans Bank, and this will be formally announced during that bank’s annual stockholders’ meeting tomorrow.\nThe bank stated that De Ocampo has formally expressed his intention to retire, a decision approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors during its most recent meeting.\n“While the Bank’s Board acknowledged his retirement, it likewise expressed its intention to retain Chairman de Ocampo’s services in some capacity, to continue to provide his unique guidance towards realizing the bank’s desired positioning and objectives,” PVB said.\nThe move comes after De Ocampo also retired as a director of EEI Corporation earlier this week, citing personal reasons. House Speaker Martin Romualdez’s RYM Business Management Corporation owns 49 percent of the bank and had recently sold its 20 percent stake in EEI.\n“De Ocampo has served Veterans Bank with distinction for 12 years, initially taking on the role of Chairman and CEO at the behest of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and the Department of Finance (DOF), who entrusted him with the mission to revitalize and reform the institution,” the bank said.\nThroughout his tenure, De Ocampo spearheaded comprehensive reforms that transformed the Bank’s governance structure, replaced and strengthened its Board of Directors, and modernized its policy frameworks and management systems.\n“His leadership was pivotal in addressing regulatory concerns raised by the BSP and in steering the Bank toward operational excellence,” the bank added.\nAmong his many accomplishments, De Ocampo successfully championed the passage of a new Veterans Bank Charter, working closely with legislators, regulators, and key stakeholders.\nUnder his guidance, the Bank navigated the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, maintaining financial stability and resilience.\nHe also led efforts to raise the Bank’s capital to meet BSP’s standards for commercial banks, ensuring its long-term viability and competitiveness.\n“The Board of Directors extended its deepest gratitude to Dr. de Ocampo for his unwavering dedication and transformative leadership.\n“The Board described his legacy as one of integrity, innovation, and impact—leaving Veterans Bank well-capitalized, profitable, and positioned as the preferred financial institution for veterans, AFP retirees, PNP personnel, and other members of the uniformed services as well as emerging as a vital and ever strengthening member of the country’s private banking sector,” Veterans Bank said.\nIt noted that, “As De Ocampo concludes his tenure, he leaves behind a legacy, being an outstanding son of a WWII veteran community and a lasting imprint on the institution—one that will continue to guide and inspire its future. He caps his tenure with a fully capitalized bank and a record profit for the first time in its history.”	"\\tImages/de-ocampo-retires-as-philippine-veterans-bank-chairman_1.png"	Dr. Roberto F. de Ocampo is retiring as Chairman of Philippine Veterans Bank after 12 years of service.

The original target was late last year.\nThe closing of the business combination is expected to occur as soon as possible, subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals and other customary closing conditions.\nUpon listing, the combined company will operate as Hotel101 Global Holdings Corp. and trade under the ticker symbol HBNB.\nOnce listed, Hotel101 will become the first Filipino-owned company to be listed and traded on Nasdaq. Hotel101 is a subsidiary of Philippine-listed DoubleDragon.\nLast week, Hotel101 said it has teamed up with Horizon Group for a major expansion in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, with plans to develop up to 10,000 hotel rooms worth $2.5 billion.\nHotel101 has signed a joint venture partnership agreement with Horizon as the main partner for its expansion into Saudi Arabia with a vision to introduce the Hotel101 brand.\nHorizon Group is a Saudi-headquartered investment company led by brothers Khaled and Abdulrahman Sharbatly, and Wael Daqal, with a focus on partnering and investing in industries with international market leaders.\nHorizon has many partnerships and affiliations such as AlNahla Group and SAMACO, and is a market leader in its industry with a preference and focused on hospitality and manufacturing.\nAn initial five locations for Hotel101 projects have been identified, the first of which is intended to be located in Medina, followed by Riyadh, Jeddah, Abha and Alula.\nHotel101 said it recognizes the strategic opportunities presented by the Saudi market and is committed to rolling out a standardized and predictable hotel offering on average 500 rooms per site which can cater to the evolving and growing demands of the Saudi market.\nIn 2023, Saudi Arabia welcomed 27 million international tourists and 79 million domestic tourists, breaching the 100-million visitor mark.

how-fast-can-your-money-double-learn-the-rule-of-72	How fast can your money double? Learn the Rule of 72	Here’s a riddle that checks how well you understand the mathematics of growth. Let’s say we have a pond with a single lily pad. It’s a special lily pad that grows very fast, doubling in size every day. It’s expected that on the 30th day, the pond will be fully covered by this lily pad. \nHere’s the question: Given what we know about the pond and the lily pad, on which day was half of the pond’s space taken up by the lily pad? Try coming up with your own answer first before reading on!\nIt’s tempting to answer day 15. After all, if we’re solving for when the pond is halfway filled, then the halfway point of our 30-day time horizon feels intuitive. But the correct answer is actually day 29! If our lily pad doubles in size every day, that means if our voracious lily pad covers half the pond on day 29, it will cover the whole pond on day 30, since a doubled half makes a whole!\nADVERTISEMENT\nThis riddle illustrates the importance of understanding compounding growth. Compounding is when an object’s growth relies on its size in the previous time period. Investing works this way: a 10 percent growth applied to ₱10 is just ₱1, but apply that 10 percent growth to a billion pesos, and your wealth grows by ₱100 million. When it comes to investing, the amount of capital you start with matters.\nCompounding isn't intuitive for most people because we naturally think in terms of linear growth, where growth is just constant over time. It’s like stashing a thousand pesos of your salary every month under your mattress. After a year, you end up with a growth of twelve thousand pesos, regardless of how much money you started with. It’s straightforward, intuitive, and linear, but ultimately, not very useful in the context of investments.\nInvesting relies on compounding, not linear growth. Most people already know that stocks and bank accounts grow in percentages, but assets that give you cash flow can multiply as well through reinvestment. When you take the interest and rent payments from your bonds and real estate and buy more bonds and real estate, your portfolio grows in size, making your next cash flow payouts bigger. All investments have the potential for compounding growth.\nAs you can see, compounding is terribly important for investments. However, as our lily pad riddle shows, the math can be unintuitive. Even if you got the answer correct, chances are you had to override your natural linear instincts to solve for the correct answer, and that’s just a simple question solving for one time period. What if you need to know how much a stock portfolio will grow after sixteen years? That’s quite hard to solve without a calculator!\nADVERTISEMENT\nFortunately, there’s a quick mental calculation we can perform called the Rule of 72. Here’s how it works: To estimate how long it takes for your investment to double, just divide 72 by the growth rate of your investment.\nLet's take a practical example. Historically, stocks have returned roughly eight percent to 10 percent annually over the long run. Suppose you invest PHP 100 at an average annual return of 9%. How long will it take for that money to double?\nUsing the Rule of 72, you'd divide 72 by nine, resulting in eight. This means that your PHP 100 investment would double to PHP 200 in approximately eight years if it compounds at a 9% annual rate. If you pull out a calculator, you’ll find that a 9% annual growth over eight years yields a total growth of 99.26% – more than reliable enough for quick estimates.\nThanks to the Rule of 72, we can easily estimate that a 9% investment doubles every 8 years. With this knowledge, we can roughly project future compounding growth. Your PHP 100 investment will be worth around PHP 200 in year eight, around PHP 400 in year sixteen, around PHP 800 in year twenty-four, and so on.\nWhile the exact growth rates may differ based on the specific financial products, the Rule of 72 remains universally applicable. Whether you're assessing stocks, bonds, or bank accounts, using the Rule of 72 on your expected rate of return gives you a quick, practical sense of how your money might grow over time.\nCompounding is essential to building wealth through investments. Although the math can be unintuitive, as the lily pad riddle has shown, the Rule of 72 can simplify this complexity, offering an easy-to-use shortcut for calculating your investment growth over time.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIncorporate the Rule of 72 into your financial planning toolkit. It provides quick and reliable estimates, empowering you to make smarter investment decisions and better manage your financial future.\nKeith Lim is a personal finance writer and stock market investor. His insights can be found at keithblim.com.	"\\tImages/how-fast-can-your-money-double-learn-the-rule-of-72_1.png"	The Rule of 72 offers a quick way to estimate how long it takes for an investment to double.  Dividing 72 by the growth rate provides an approximate doubling time.  Compounding growth, unlike linear growth, relies on the previous period's size. This rule simplifies complex calculations, making investment planning easier.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/04/how-fast-can-your-money-double-learn-the-rule-of-72
jcrs-a-rating-set-to-bolster-japanese-investment-in-philippines-says-remolona	JCR's 'A-' rating set to bolster Japanese investment in Philippines, says Remolona	Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Eli M. Remolona Jr. said the Japan Credit Rating Agency’s (JCR) latest affirmation of the Philippines’ “A-” credit rating with a stable outlook is expected to strengthen confidence among Japanese investors in the country.\nOn Thursday, June 5, JCR affirmed the Philippines’ investment-grade credit rating of “A-” with a “stable” outlook.\nAccording to the Japanese credit rating, the ratings “mainly reflect the Philippines’ high and sustained economic growth supported by solid domestic demand, low-level external debt, and resilience to external shocks supported by accumulated foreign exchange reserves.”\nIn the first quarter of 2025, the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 5.4 percent, a rate slower than the 5.7 percent growth seen in the previous year.\nThe BCP cited the stable prices as among the major drivers of the growth. Inflation averaged two percent during the first four months of the year.\n“Despite increased uncertainty due to changes in US tariff policies, [the] Philippines’ foreign exchange liquidity position remains solid, and JCR expects the economy to retain high resilience to external shocks going forward,” JCR said.\nAs per the BSP’s statement,JCR expects the country’s economic growth to stay in the upper five-percent range this year. This means falling short of the growth target of six to eight percent.\n“JCR’s affirmation will support and strengthen investment from Japan, one of the Philippines’ most important partners. The BSP will continue to safeguard price and financial stability to boost the country’s resilience amid global headwinds,” Remolona said.\nAs of end-April 2025, the Philippines’ US dollar stock or gross international reserves (GIR) stood at $105.3 billion, sufficient to cover 7.3 months of imports and 3.6 times short-term foreign debt based on residual maturity.\nIt can be recalled that Fitch Ratings also affirmed its ‘BBB’ with a stable outlook for the Philippines in April, citing easing inflation, sound monetary policy, and stable public debt as key factors.\nAn investment-grade rating indicates low credit risk and helps the government secure better financing terms for key public services and infrastructure projects.\nDOF chief Recto welcomes 'very good news'\nPresident Marcos’ chief economic manager, Finance Secretary Ralph G. Recto, said that this “very good news” means that the confidence investors in our Philippine remains strong.\nAs such, Recto assured that the government remains committed to securing more “'A” ratings “by staying faithful to our fiscal consolidation plan and road-to-A strategy.”\nHe also noted that the government has already enacted major reforms, including the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises to Maximize Opportunities for Reinvigorating the Economy (CREATE MORE) Act and the Capital Markets Efficiency Promotion Act (CMEPA).\nMoving forward, the government, he said, will continue its efforts “to attract more investments and boost economic growth.”\nJCR’s latest rating affirmation helps keep the Philippines in a strong position to retain high investment-grade ratings from major global and regional credit agencies, the DOF said.\n“Recto, together with the rest of the economic team, regularly engages with JCR and all major credit rating agencies to provide comprehensive briefings on the country’s fiscal and economic performance,” it said.	"\\tImages/jcrs-a-rating-set-to-bolster-japanese-investment-in-philippines-says-remolona_1.png"	JCR affirmed the Philippines' "A-" credit rating with a stable outlook, boosting confidence among Japanese investors.

iemop-seeks-p11-billion-for-wesm-market-management-system-upgrade	IEMOP seeks ₱1.1 billion for WESM market management system upgrade	The Independent Electricity Market Operator of the Philippines (IEMOP) is seeking an additional budget for its market management system (MMS) for the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM).\nIn a document posted by the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC), IEMOP is requesting around ₱1.1 billion in additional market fees to fund the MMS project, which is critical infrastructure supporting spot market operations.\nIEMOP states that the current system is aged and requires hardware upgrades. "Having been commissioned in 2015, the current MMS has already reached its useful life of almost nine years and has thus shown signs of performance degradation. It has been in operation 24/7 since May 15, 2016, already exceeding the usual service life of an electronic equipment," IEMOP explained.\nThe market operator estimates that keeping the current system operational for the next 10 years, starting in 2025, would cost approximately ₱1.5 billion. "This estimate is based on a business-as-usual scenario, where the MMS will only be required to function at its current specifications and does not include enhancements to implement recent and upcoming programs and policies directed by the Honorable Commission and the Department of Energy (DOE)," it added.\nIEMOP aims to replace the current system by 2027 to meet growing market demands and address WESM requirements. These include increased transaction volumes, the integration of renewable energy (RE) sources, energy storage systems, and regulatory compliance.\nFurthermore, the upgraded MMS would address cybersecurity vulnerabilities. IEMOP elaborated, "Additionally, the new system is being developed with the capability to support enhancements in market operations, including potential future integration of a day-ahead mechanism, should this be approved in the future."\nIf approved by regulators, the additional market charges would be collected over a four-year period and added to the current market rates. These fees would be charged to generators in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.

first-philippine-holdings-bets-big-on-power-property-with-57-billion-investment-plan	First Philippine Holdings bets big on power, property with ₱57-billion investment plan	Lopez-led First Philippine Holdings Corporation (FPH) is focusing on the growth of its power generation and real estate businesses, which are being allocated the bulk of the group’s planned investments amounting to ₱57 billion this year.\nOn the sidelines of the firm’s annual stockholders’ meeting, FPH Chief Finance Officer and Treasurer Emmanuel Antonio P. Singson said power subsidiary First Gen Corporation will get the lion’s share of $600 million or about ₱33 billion.\n“That’s primarily for EDC (geothermal firm Energy Development Corporation), and they’ll fund it through debt at the EDC level. They’re planning to borrow about ₱27 billion in 2025,” he said.\nSingson said Rockwell Land and First Philippine Industrial Park will get a combined share of ₱22 billion which the subsidiaries will also finance through debt at their level.\n“There is no debt nor is there going to be any fundraising at the parent company of FPH level. The subsidiaries will be able to finance it through their own leverage,” he added noting that these will be sourced from bank debts, bilateral or syndicated club loans.\nFPH President Francis Giles Puno said that, “At the end of 2024, our total assets consisted of only 28 percent gas investments, with the balance 72 percent investments on renewable energy.\n“In 2025 we forecast that the percent composition of gas on our total assets will further decline, emphasizing our dedication to building our renewable energy portfolio.”\nMeanwhile, Rockwell, with its recent handovers, launches and a robust pipeline of projects, continues to broaden its reach while upholding the quality and design excellence it is known for, positioning itself for sustained growth in the years ahead.\nFPIP stands as the preferred investment hub for world-class manufacturers. Home to over 150 locators and 80,000 Filipino workers, FPIP welcomed exciting new expansions in 2024, including Dyson’s Global Development Center and Collins Aerospace’s expanded aircraft seating module production.\n“FPIP caters to what is arguably the best ecosystem of world-class locators in the country, and continues to remain faithful to its mission of building industries, creating value-add jobs and nurturing thriving communities,” Puno said.

dotr-orders-airasia-move-to-stop-selling-philippine-tickets-over-alleged-overpricing	DOTr orders AirAsia MOVE to stop selling Philippine tickets over alleged overpricing	The Department of Transportation (DOTr) has ordered AirAsia MOVE, the online booking arm of Malaysia-based AirAsia, to cease selling airline tickets in the Philippines due to reports of alleged fare overcharging.\nIn a press conference on Monday, June 2, Transportation Secretary Vince Dizon stated that Leyte 4th District Rep. Richard Gomez had alerted him about the platform’s high ticket prices.\nBased on a booking done last weekend, a Philippine Airlines (PAL) ticket from Tacloban to Manila for two passengers was listed for as much as ₱77,720 in AirAsia Move.\nBooking directly on the flag carrier’s website showed that the one ticket cost just around ₱12,100 during the same period.\n“So clearly, this is just absurd. What AirAsia MOVE is doing is criminal,” said Dizon.\nDizon suggested that the platform could have increased its fare “to take advantage” of the state of emergency across various areas in Eastern Visayas following the load restrictions at the San Juanico Bridge.\n“Alam na mayroong crisis doon at hirap ‘yung movement ng goods and ng people, dahil nga sa partial closure ng San Juanico. Kaya clearly, mayro’ng nag-take advantage,” the secretary said.\n(It’s known that there’s a crisis there and that the movement of goods and people is difficult because of the partial closure of San Juanico. So clearly, someone took advantage.)\n“We will really put the full force of the government of the law on these unscrupulous online platforms who are taking advantage of our people,” he added.\nDizon has asked the cybercrime unit of the Philippine National Police (PNP) to take down AirAsia Move’s website and mobile application as part of the cease-and-desist order by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB).\nThe CAB, which sets the ceiling of airfare prices in the country, earlier flagged AirAsia MOVE for “unauthorized sale of airline tickets for carriers in the Philippines at prices exceeding the approved fare structures.”\nIt asked the platform to stop offering, promoting, or selling such tickets.\nIn its response to the agency, AirAsia MOVE said it would comply with the order. However, it argued that as a foreign-based online travel agent, it is not under the jurisdiction of the CAB.\nCAB Executive Director Carmelo Arcilla has since clarified that while the platform is not under the agency’s jurisdiction, the matter of airfare is within its mandate.\n“For domestic services, we approve fares because it's required by law. We set the ceiling and when that ceiling is violated by an entity, even if they are not defined under our jurisdiction, they come within our enforcement,” said Arcilla.\nArcilla added that unreasonable prices on the platform could be considered price gouging on the account that the price hike is not justified by supply and demand given the current situation in Eastern Visayas.\nAs of writing, AirAsia MOVE’s website remains accessible, with tickets for Tacloban to Manila costing around ₱10,000.\nDizon, meanwhile, said the government will file a case for economic sabotage against the company over the reported overpricing.\nHe has also ordered the CAB to investigate other instances of high pricing on other destinations in the country.\nIn a statement sent to the media, AirAsia MOVE emphasized that it “does not manually set or manipulate airfares.”\n“As an online travel agency, [AirAsia] MOVE displays flight inventory and pricing data as provided by its authorized upstream suppliers, including third-party aggregators and Global Distribution Systems,” said Asia Move Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Nadia Omer.\n“The discrepancies in fare displays for certain routes, including domestic flights operated by [PAL], were caused by temporary data synchronization issues with flight pricing partners,” she added.\nAccording to AirAsia MOVE, these technical discrepancies is not isolated to the platform as it also affected the likes of Agoda, Kiwi.com, and Traveloka.\nNonetheless, Omer said the company will fully cooperate with the government to uphold fair pricing and consumer protection.\nOmer said steps have been taken to prevent any future recurrence of excessive fairs.\nThe Malaysia-based AirAsia MOVE is an affiliate of budget carrier AirAsia Philippines.	"\\tImages/dotr-orders-airasia-move-to-stop-selling-philippine-tickets-over-alleged-overpricing_1.png"	The DOTr ordered AirAsia MOVE to stop selling Philippine airline tickets due to alleged overpricing, citing a case where a ticket cost ₱77,720 on AirAsia MOVE versus ₱12,100 on the airline's website.  Transportation Secretary Vince Dizon called the pricing "absurd" and "criminal," suggesting exploitation of the crisis in Eastern Visayas.  AirAsia MOVE claims the discrepancies were due to technical issues, but the government will file an economic sabotage case. The CAB will investigate other pricing instances.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/02/dotr-orders-airasia-move-to-stop-selling-philippine-tickets-over-alleged-overpricing
edsa-rehab-government-shifts-gears-now-aims-for-six-month-completion	EDSA rehab: Government shifts gears, now aims for six-month completion	The decades-long wait for the rehabilitation of Metro Manila’s main thoroughfare will take even longer as the government prepares to overhaul its plans on the project after President Marcos ordered the construction to be cut to just six months.\nThe Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), Department of Transportation (DOTr), and Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA)—the agencies in charge of the rebuild project—disclosed last month the government’s ₱8.7 billion plan to improve EDSA.\nThe project, which aims to transform EDSA into a commuter- and pedestrian-friendly highway, is expected to take between 1.5 and 2 years.\nOn Sunday, June 1, Marcos announced the postponement of the project for one month to accommodate a new construction plan. Preparatory work was scheduled for June 13.\nThis plan, he said, is focused on shortening the timeline to just six months to a year, aiming to reduce the inconvenience and heavy traffic expected from the project.\nIn a press briefing on Monday, Transportation Secretary Vince Dizon stated that this is a “clear message” from the President, acknowledging the challenges the project will bring to residents of the capital region.\n“So what the President has said is ‘let's go back to the drawing board,’ let's find a better way that is shorter and, obviously, if it's shorter it will be cheaper,” said Dizon.\nThe secretary floated that Marcos has spoken to specific groups that told him of “non-conventional ways” of expediting the project.\nThe country’s top leader was quoted as saying that the government has seen “new technologies” that were not used in the planning of the EDSA rebuild.\nDizon did not divulge what these new methods are, but noted that “there are better ways.”\nHe said the new plan will shift from the “conventional method” of repairing the highway lane by lane, which will require a longer time.\nAs the first major rebuild of EDSA since 1980, the government had earlier planned to replace the pavement with new concrete and asphalt.\nAfter the President’s announcement, the agencies overseeing the project return to the drawing board to determine the new direction.\nWith limited time to devise a plan, Dizon has cast doubt on whether the one-month pause is sufficient.\n“I'm not sure if that's enough, we will have to find out,” he pointed out.\nHe, however, denied that these sudden changes is just a convoluted prelude to an indefinite suspension of the rehabilitation efforts—which already happened several times over the course of different administrations.\n“The President's resolve is not only in rebuilding EDSA but in making sure that the inconvenience to the motoring public and to the computers is minimized, using the most advanced technology that is out there,” said Dizon.\nWith the postponement of the project, the No Contact Apprehension Policy (NCAP) is expected to remain.\nThe DOTr chief said the NCAP, in which the MMDA oversees traffic violations through CCTVs, is an efficient way for the government to enforce traffic rules.\nLikewise, traffic mitigation measures such as more buses in the EDSA Carousel and adding more capacity to Metro Manila’s railways will still be implemented despite a suspension in the project.\nOn the contrary, the odd-even scheme will not be pursued. Further, the free toll in Skyway Stage 3 will be on hold.\n“Finding a better way is not just about the technology that's going to be used to construct and to rebuild EDSA, it's also finding better ways of mitigating the effects of a rebuild,” said Dizon.

The ₱8.7 billion project, initially slated for 1.5-2 years, faces a one-month postponement for a revised plan using "non-conventional ways".

despite-skepticism-asean-power-grid-has-potential-pids	Despite skepticism, ASEAN Power Grid has potential—PIDS	State-run think tank Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS) believes that skepticism surrounding the feasibility of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Power Grid is likely to diminish over time, citing investments that could help address this years-long concern.\nIn an exclusive interview with Adoracion Navarro, senior fellow at PIDS, she shared that it is too early to doubt the feasibility of ASEAN energy integration.\n“The Laos-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore interconnection project has seen early successes as an example of a multilateral agreement on energy trading and infrastructure investments, so I believe the skepticism will diminish eventually,” Navarro cited an example to Manila Bulletin.\n“Besides, it seems too early to be skeptical of the feasibility given that for the eastern part where we will be participating, that is, the BIMP-PIP (Brunei Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines power integration project), the feasibility study is yet to be completed,” she added.\nThe BIMP energy initiative is designed to connect the power grids of the four countries to allow cross-border electricity trade and is expected to address regional power cooperation.\nLast month, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. called for an even greater “synergy, innovation, and political will” within the BIMP East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA).\nThe member countries are expected to focus on key economic movements such as the greater power interconnection, trade, investments, tourism, infrastructure development, as well as socio-cultural and educational exchange.\n“For all we know, feasibility concerns can be addressed by adjusting the timing of investments and the nature or location of investments based on the current realities that the participating countries face,” Navarro said.\nThe PIDS senior fellow recalled earlier plans for the ASEAN grid link, which initially considered southern Mindanao as a potential connection point, with Palawan later emerging as another viable option.\n“If one is to look at the renewable energy (RE) potential in Palawan relative to demand, it can be a net exporter given that its wind energy potential is more than 10 times its energy demand,” she said, emphasizing the need to bring in more solar and hydropower capacity.\n“Part of the necessary preparations for interconnecting with other countries is transmission network upgrade within Palawan. The policy environment for large-scale battery storage systems should also be set, and the efforts to amend the Electric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA) provide an opportunity for doing so,” Navarro added.\nIn a set of comments on the proposed Senate bill aimed at strengthening the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) last December, PIDS emphasized the need to empower the commission to enforce the adoption of clean energy technologies, including smart grid systems, smart distribution networks, and the digital transformation of electric cooperatives.\n“The policy environment for large-scale battery storage systems should also be set, and the efforts to amend the EPIRA provide an opportunity for doing so. We also have to review the presence, adequacy, and effectiveness of our policies for submarine cable protection zones or protection corridors, submarine crossing agreements, monitoring, regulatory regime, and liability rules, and then check if there are some things we need to fix,” she elaborated.\nMoreover, Navarro highlighted the need to improve the energy sector’s rules and regulations, which goes beyond the focus on Palawan’s potential grid link or the BIMP.	"\\tImages/despite-skepticism-asean-power-grid-has-potentialpids_1.png"	The Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS) believes skepticism over the ASEAN Power Grid will lessen with time due to investments.  The Laos-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore interconnection project shows early success in multilateral energy agreements.  Feasibility concerns can be addressed by adjusting investment timing and location. Palawan's renewable energy potential, particularly wind energy, makes it a viable connection point.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/05/despite-skepticism-asean-power-grid-has-potentialpids

economists-see-bsp-cutting-interest-rates-by-25-bps-on-june-19-after-inflation-fell-to-nearly-six-year-low	Economists see BSP cutting interest rates by 25 bps on June 19 after inflation fell to nearly six-year low	With inflation accelerating to its lowest pace in nearly six years in May, private-sector economists expect the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) to continue reducing key borrowing costs this month.\nInflation slowed further to 1.3 percent in May from 1.4 percent in April, marking the slowest pace since November 2019, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). Notably, the poorest households experienced no increase in overall prices.\nAccording to the PSA, the continued easing of inflation in May was mainly due to the slower price movements in the housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels sub-index. It clocked in at 2.3 percent in May from 2.9 percent in April.\nHSBC ASEAN economist Aris Dacanay said in a commentary released on Thursday, June 5, that the latest inflation rate raises the likelihood of the BSP further slashing key interest rates during the upcoming June 19 policy meeting.\n“May inflation increases the risk of a June policy rate cut,” Dacanay said, adding that this expectation becomes even more likely because global factors are “keeping a lid on goods and energy prices.”\nMiguel Chanco, chief emerging Asia economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, also said the think tank is maintaining its “below-consensus” expectation that the central bank’s benchmark rate will settle at 4.75 percent by year-end.\nThis means that Chanco is expecting the BSP to deliver three more quarter-point cuts, “including the next in two weeks’ time” in June.\nTo date, the BSP has slashed the key policy rate by a total of 100 basis points (bps) or one percent.\nAs such, the rate has fallen from 6.5 percent before easing began in August last year to the current 5.5 percent. Among the major developments considered in the latest cut was the heightened uncertainties caused by the United States (US)-imposed tariffs.\n“The BSP does have the privilege to take a measured approach given how insulated the economy is to any headwind in trade,” Dacanay said.\n“However, with inflation floating well-below the BSP’s forecast range, the risk of a policy rate cut in June has substantially increased, more so the first quarter growth surprising to the downside,” he added.\nFalling below expectations, Philippine gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 5.4 percent in the first quarter, slower than the 5.7 percent in the same period last year. This was also significantly short of the government’s growth target of six to eight percent.\nFor Dacanay, the most likely scenario would be a pause in the BSP’s easing cycle in June, as the central bank “waits for more details regarding the US’ proposed tariff measures.”\nSince US President Donald Trump ordered a three-month pause on the across-the-board reciprocal tariffs, the Philippine government has been negotiating with the trade giant to lower the 17-percent tariff it slapped on Philippine exports.\nDacanay also pointed to the peso’s relative strength which “may have also given the BSP room to cut policy rates regardless of whether the US Federal Reserve cuts rates or not.”\nCiting these, Dacanay said the upcoming Monetary Board (MB) “will likely be a tough call.”\nNevertheless, Dacanay said that inflation still faces upward risks that need close monitoring, which include Congress’ passage of a ₱200 across-the-board minimum wage hike. Policymakers are also considering raising rice tariffs based on seasonal supply.\nIf all these measures are implemented, Dacanay said these could significantly affect the inflation outlook and may prompt the BSP to reassess the pace of its rate-cutting cycle.

Lao said cash flow will continue to be healthy and “we do expect profitability to continue to increase. So, we’re quite comfortable in terms of the outlook of future years’ dividends.”\nMeanwhile, he said that, “as part of the efforts of ramping up production in our Batangas plant, we’re focusing on exports and, because of that, we are visiting clients in other countries, attending trade shows and exhibitions, to try and drum up business. Because of that, we are able to get new clients in new markets all the time.”\nWhile global uncertainties seem to be the dominant theme affecting business sentiment in the near-term, D&L remains unfazed and continues to focus on building resiliency and long-term growth strategies.\n“Management believes that with D&L’s product portfolio, the majority of which cater to basic and essential industries, the company will continue to grow and be relevant in an ever-changing business environment and world trade order.\n“Over the longer-term, management has a lot of confidence that the new investments that the company has made over the past years will pave the way for higher and more sustainable profit growth,” D&L said.\nDuring the stockholders’ meeting D&L Industries declared total cash dividends of ₱1.52 billion, higher than the ₱1.49 billion payout last year.\nThis year’s dividends consist of a regular cash dividend of ₱0.164 per share, plus a special cash dividend of ₱0.049 per share, to shareholders of record as of June 18. Ex-date is on June 17 and payment will be made within 30 days of the dividend declaration or on July 2.\n“Management remains highly committed to its regular dividend policy of a 50 percent payout ratio based on prior year’s net income. On top of that, for the fifth consecutive year since the peak of the pandemic in 2020, D&L was able to declare special dividends,” the company said.\nIncluding this year’s payment, the Company has returned a total of ₱18.3 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends since the IPO in 2012. The company also paid a 100 percent stock dividend in September 2015.\nThis year’s special dividends amount to 15 percent of prior year’s net income. In total, this year’s payout ratio remains at 65 percent of prior year’s net income, consistent with the payout ratio over the past three years. The ₱0.213 per share dividend this year translates to a 3.8 percent yield based on May 30’s closing price of ₱5.64 per share.\nIn 2024, D&L Industries’ recurring income reached ₱2.3 billion, or earnings per share of ₱0.328 centavos. This is higher by two percent year-on-year.\nDespite the higher operating and interest expenses associated with the new plant in Batangas, the continued ramp up in operations helped offset the incremental expenses.\nThe new plant turned profitable in 2014, booking a net profit of ₱246 million for the full year. This is ahead of the initial schedule of within two years of operations which was based on the performance of the older plants that the company had built over the years.\nWith the boost coming from the Batangas plant, D&L’s income for the first quarter of 2025 grew by 10 percent YoY to ₱681 million despite macroeconomic uncertainties during the period.\nWith the increasing income contribution from Batangas plant, the company’s return ratios have started to see improvements.\nROE stood at 12.1 percent for the quarter, higher by 1.4 ppts from the full year 2024 level. Meanwhile, ROIC stood at 10 percent for the quarter, higher by one ppt from the full-year 2024 level.

consecutive-bsp-rate-cuts-coming-in-june-and-august-deutsche-bank	Consecutive BSP rate cuts coming in June and August—Deutsche Bank	The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) is seen cutting interest rates for two consecutive policy meetings as inflation falls to below-target levels, according to Deutsche Bank Research.\nIn a May 31 report emailed on Monday, June 2, Deutsche Bank Research forecast headline inflation in May at 1.5 percent, remaining below the targeted two- to four-percent band of manageable annual price increases conducive to economic growth. The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) will release the consumer price index (CPI) inflation report on Thursday, June 5.\n"Rice prices are likely to remain low amid a global supply glut and the rollout of ₱20-per-kilogram subsidized rice, as well as the June 2024 reduction in rice tariffs which would continue to work its way through," it said.\nDomestic fuel prices are also projected to drop alongside downward global oil price movements, it added.\nFor Deutsche Bank Research, "below-target inflation and weaker-than-expected growth pave the way for the BSP's next 25-basis point (bp) rate cut in the June meeting." Philippine gross domestic product (GDP) grew by a disappointing 5.4 percent in the first quarter of 2025.\nThe Monetary Board (MB), the BSP's highest policy-making body, will next decide on the monetary policy stance on June 19. It is widely expected to cut key interest rates again after resuming the easing cycle in April, when it reduced the policy rate by 25 bps to the current 5.5 percent.\nIn a May 27 report obtained by Manila Bulletin, Deutsche Bank Research economist Junjie Huang forecast 25 bps each of interest rate cuts at the MB's June and Aug. 28 policy meetings, citing BSP Governor Eli M. Remolona Jr.'s recent pronouncements of "maybe two more cuts" before the year ends.\n"To be sure, we had only expected two more cuts in the BSP's current easing cycle with the terminal rate at five percent. Our view was on the premise that the BSP would prefer to maintain a sufficiently positive interest rate differential vis-à-vis the Fed. The differential would be [approximately] 0.6 percent as the policy rate approaches five percent, assuming the FFR [federal funds rate] remains unchanged, making it the narrowest in recent periods," Huang explained.\nWhile Remolona had said the upcoming interest rate reductions would "not necessarily be consecutive," Huang believes the BSP chief "likely referred to concerns around currency volatility and the pass-through to inflation."\n"That is, if conditions were volatile then the rate cut in that month may be postponed. However, the risk of breaching the BSP's upper-end inflation target remains limited," Huang said.\nDeutsche Bank Research had slashed its full-year 2025 inflation forecast for the Philippines to 1.9 percent from 2.4 percent previously, amid low rice prices plus falling oil costs.\nAs for Remolona's plan to designate a point target for inflation, instead of the current practice of providing a range, starting next year—supposedly to avoid sending mixed signals about price increase tolerance to the market—Huang said: "To be fair, we think that the BSP at present has been fairly clear in its policy communication and intent."

eccp-warns-of-organized-crime-using-unlicensed-crypto-platforms	ECCP warns of organized crime using unlicensed crypto platforms	The government should intensify its crackdown on unlicensed cryptocurrency platforms with financial ties to organized crime syndicates, according to a ranking official of the European Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines (ECCP).\nECCP ICT Committee co-chair Reyner Villaseñor said that these platforms, which operate without regulatory oversight, are fueling what he calls a “digital crime epidemic.”\n“Criminal syndicates are exploiting regulatory gaps to carry out diverse illegal activities, using unlicensed and unregulated cryptocurrency platforms as their tools,” Villaseñor said in a statement.\nHe said these platforms are enabling criminals to move millions in illicit funds with little to no trace, potentially leading to criminal activities such as kidnappings, human trafficking, large-scale scams, illegal drugs, and illegal gambling operations.\nCiting data from the Global Anti-Scam Alliance, Villaseñor said Filipinos have lost an estimated ₱460 billion to online crime last year, equivalent to 1.9 percent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP).\nThe Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), meanwhile, recorded a massive 212 percent year-on-year increase in cybercrime-related losses among supervised financial institutions, totaling ₱5.82 billion in losses.\n“These numbers paint a grim picture: the Philippines is now in the midst of a digitally enabled crime epidemic—one that calls for immediate public vigilance, private sector safeguards, and proactive regulatory intervention and law enforcement action,” said Villaseñor.\nWithout proper regulatory measures, unlicensed cryptocurrency platforms are essentially a haven for criminals to near-total anonymity while committing illegal activities.\nVillaseñor recalled the case of Chinese businessman Anson Que, whose ₱ 200 million ransom was converted to cryptocurrency, making tracing efforts difficult. Que was later found dead, alongside his driver.\nThe ECCP official noted that some of these platforms offer advanced obfuscation tools, such as coin mixers and privacy-centric tokens, which are designed to evade detection.\nForeign-based, unlicensed exchanges, in particular, are cited for their non-cooperation on this matter, often using the veil of jurisdictional loopholes and offshore privacy laws.\nDespite advisories and directives from the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC), they continue to operate in the Philippines, accessible to not only Filipinos but also to foreign criminal syndicates.\n“This is not just a regulatory oversight—it’s a national security crisis in the making,” stressed Villaseñor.\nWith this, he is pushing the government to delist unauthorized crypto platforms swiftly, pursue strict enforcement at the level of the internet service provider, deploy advanced cybercrime tracking technologies, and run a digital literacy campaign.\nVillaseñor said the country faces the risk of institutionalizing lawlessness in its digital infrastructure unless decisive action is taken.

Thus, a call to defer the passage of such changes.\nAER has appealed to the Senate panel of the bicameral conference committee to defer the passage of proposed amendments to the Universal Health Care (UHC) Law, which was enacted in 2019 and is currently under congressional review.\nWith the “grave” concern also being raised by the DOF, the group, in a statement released on Monday, June 2, expressed support to the position of the Finance department “to retain the current PhilHealth premium rates and improve the benefit packages.”\nOne of the major changes that is deemed to have “catastrophic consequences” is the proposal to slash the state-run health insurer’s premium rates to 3.5 percent by next year from the current five percent.\nThe group noted that this comes amid expansion and improvement of PhilHealth benefits that will “require increased and sustainable financing.”\n“The proposed reductions in premiums, alongside a zero-budget allocation for PhilHealth in 2025 and the ₱60-billion funds transferred to the national treasury, raise serious concerns about PhilHealth’s financial capacity, which could jeopardize the sustainability of benefit delivery,” AER said.\nAs cited by the group, the DOF sees the rate reduction undermining the funding of the expansion of benefits that the Marcos administration and PhilHealth have promised.\n“A decline in PhilHealth funds due to the decreased premium will result in a failure to reduce the out-of-pocket health expenses, especially of the lower-income class,” AER argued.\nAER said Congress’ push to lower PhilHealth premiums assumes the agency has excess funds, but Supreme Court (SC) arguments revealed its liabilities exceed its reserves.\nAER also flagged other contentious amendments beyond premium adjustments, including provisions on health technology assessment, competition in service delivery, health information, and governance.\nIt said that the call to defer the amendments also recognizes that PhilHealth’s new leadership is currently reviewing policies to strengthen reform efforts, while the pending SC ruling on the fund transfer is expected to significantly influence the interpretation of the UHC Law.\nAER maintains that it would be more prudent for Congress to pause the amendments, await the SC ruling, and thoroughly assess the UHC Law “rather than rush to legislate questionable provisions.”	"\\tImages/economic-reforms-group-backs-dof-on-retaining-5-philhealth-premium-warns-of-catastrophic-impact-from-rate-cut_1.png"	The Action for Economic Reforms (AER) supports the Department of Finance (DOF) in keeping PhilHealth's premium at 5%, warning that a reduction would be catastrophic.  Lowering the rate to 3.5% would create a potential crisis in the health system, jeopardizing benefit delivery.  This comes amid PhilHealth benefit expansions requiring increased funding, and the DOF views a rate cut as undermining promised benefit expansions.  Congress's push to lower premiums assumes excess funds, but the Supreme Court revealed PhilHealth's liabilities exceed its reserves.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/02/economic-reforms-group-backs-dof-on-retaining-5-philhealth-premium-warns-of-catastrophic-impact-from-rate-cut
foreign-airlines-eye-terminal-fees-at-naia-amid-rising-costs	Foreign airlines eye terminal fees at NAIA amid rising costs	International airlines are expected to submit proposals to collect terminal enhancement fees, aiming to shoulder the rising costs of using the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA), according to the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB).\nCAB Executive Director Carmelo Arcilla said these foreign-headquartered carriers have indicated to the agency their eagerness to file their respective petitions.\nArcilla said these airlines, which are represented by the Airline Operators Council (AOC) and the Board of Airline Representatives (BAR), are monitoring the outcome of the proposals earlier filed by local carriers.\n“They are waiting. They are in the wings just waiting for what will happen with the local [airlines],” he said in a chance interview.\nLast year, Philippine Airlines, Cebu Pacific, and AirAsia Philippines pushed for the approval of the terminal enhancement fees amid higher expenses at the country’s main gateway.\nNAIA, which was taken over by San Miguel Corp.-led consortium New NAIA Infra Corp. (NNIC), has since seen increases in landing and takeoff fees, alongside other fees.\nThe three airlines sought a terminal enhancement fee for a domestic flight for ₱75 and as much as ₱300 for an international flight.\nArcilla said the proposal remains pending as CAB awaits the local carriers’ final submission of required documents.\nHe said the agency, which oversees the economic aspects of the aviation sector, has no timeline yet on the final decision over the matter.\nIf approved, the fee is expected to be listed as a separate charge on top of the base fare, similar to the fuel surcharge, value-added tax (VAT), and passenger service charge (PSC). \nNNIC, which took over operations and maintenance of NAIA in September 2024, is scheduled to implement a higher PSC for its first anniversary this year.\nAdministrative Order No. 1, penned by NAIA’s regulator Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA), stated that the PSC will increase from ₱550 to ₱950 for international departing passengers and from ₱200 to ₱390 for domestic departing passengers.\nThe fee will be adjusted again in the sixth and 11th year of the 15-year concession period. \nWith the contract’s potential extension, the PSC will face another hike in the 16th and 21st year.

These carriers are awaiting the outcome of similar proposals from local airlines.  The fees, if approved, would be added to the base fare.  NAIA's operator, NNIC, is also raising passenger service charges.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/02/foreign-airlines-eye-terminal-fees-at-naia-amid-rising-costs
da-extends-deadline-for-issuance-of-fish-import-permits-to-end-june	DA extends deadline for issuance of fish import permits to end-June	The Department of Agriculture (DA) has extended the deadline for the issuance of fish and seafood import permits to the end of June, following the government’s recent policy shift in importation.\nPresident Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. has ordered the DA to “rationalize” fish importation to stabilize supply and prices for tourism and high-end food sectors.\nMarcos said the new policy is to bring products such as fish into the country, while generating more jobs and attracting investments.\nAgriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel is pushing the deadline to the end of the month to give more imports time to adjust to the new policy.\nEarlier this year, the DA approved the importation of up to 25,000 metric tons of fish and seafood, primarily for the food service, tourism, and hospitality industries.\nHowever, only about a quarter of that volume has been brought into the country so far.\nLaurel said the low uptake was caused by the strict importation timelines and sourcing constraints.\n“It’s more of a systemic issue than low demand,” said Laurel. “The timeframes we set were too short, and many of the approved products were out of season in their countries of origin.”\n“It was also challenging for some importers to meet requirements tied to larger volume allocations,” he added.\nThe DA’s approved list of imports covers a variety of species, including salmon, cod, tuna by-products, squid, scallops, octopus, and lobster.\nThese marine products are allowed to be sourced from other countries as they are not locally sufficient.\nLaurel said the only exception to the approved imports is sardines, which were allowed because it was off-season in certain fishing grounds.\n“Sardines are the most affordable fish available to help address inflation concerns,” he noted.\nImporters accredited under Fisheries Administrative Order (FAO) 195 and those registered under FAO 259 are eligible for fish import allocations through the Certificate of Necessity to Import, which allows importation during the closed fishing season.\nFAO 195 covers the importation of fresh, chilled, or frozen fish and aquatic products, while FAO 259 applies to imports for wet markets during the closed season.	"\\tImages/da-extends-deadline-for-issuance-of-fish-import-permits-to-end-june_1.png"	The Department of Agriculture (DA) extended the deadline for fish import permits to June 30th due to a recent policy shift.  President Marcos ordered the DA to rationalize fish imports to stabilize supply and prices.  Low uptake was attributed to short timelines and sourcing issues, not low demand.  The approved imports include various species, with sardines being an exception due to inflation concerns.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/03/da-extends-deadline-for-issuance-of-fish-import-permits-to-end-june
map-deeply-concerned-as-senate-returns-impeachment-case-to-house	MAP 'deeply concerned' as Senate returns impeachment case to House	The Management Association of the Philippines (MAP), comprising the country’s leading business executives, is “deeply concerned” over the Senate’s decision to return the impeachment case of Vice President Sara Duterte to the House of Representatives, warning of its potential economic impact.\nThe influential business group stated that the Senate has the constitutional duty to conduct the impeachment trial of Duterte “without any delay or disruption.”\n“Abandoning this mandate undermines the integrity of our democratic processes,” MAP said in a statement, signed by its president Al Panlilio and national issues committee chair Rene Almendras.\nMAP said that this issue is no longer restricted to mere politics, as it is “fundamentally about good governance and the rule of law.”\nOn Tuesday evening, June 11, the Senate officially convened for an impeachment trial, marking the start of proceedings after months of delay.\nHowever, 18 senators voted to swiftly remand the articles of impeachment against the country’s second-highest official to the lower chamber, citing the need to address supposed constitutional infirmities. Only five senators voted against this move.\nWhile Senate leadership has insisted that this is not equivalent to a dismissal of the case, pro-impeachment lawmakers cast doubt over the matter.\nMAP is now urging senators to “rise to the occasion” and reaffirm their role as a pillar of good governance and the rule of law by continuing the impeachment trial.\n“By allowing the trial to proceed, the Senate would affirm its commitment to transparency, accountability, and other principles of good governance,” it said.\nThe group added that the trial would give the prosecution a fair chance to present its case, and the defense a full opportunity to respond and clear the vice president’s name.\nMAP said that upholding the rule of law is critical to ensure a stable and predictable environment for economic growth.\n“It builds investor confidence, attracts job-generating investments, and ultimately benefits all Filipinos,” the group added.

gcash-gears-up-for-public-offering-with-stock-split-to-enhance-accessibility	GCash gears up for public offering with stock split to enhance accessibility	Ayala Corporation reported that Globe Fintech Innovations Inc. (Mynt, the owner of GCash) is undergoing a stock split that will result in a lower par value per share and increase its market appeal when it launches its initial public offering.\nIn a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange, Ayala stated that the Board of Directors and shareholders of Mynt have approved the proposed stock split at a special board meeting and annual stockholders’ meeting.\nThe stock split will reduce the par value of Mynt’s common shares from ₱1.00 to ₱0.03 per share, thereby increasing the number of authorized common shares from 2.15 billion to 71.66 billion.\nMynt’s authorized capital stock will remain at ₱2.15 billion. Mynt has yet to file its registration statement for its planned IPO.\nUnicapital Securities Inc. Research Analyst Peter Louise D. Garnace said "We think the stock split is being done in preparation for the upcoming IPO of GCash--which is common practice for firms planning to list publicly."\nHe added that, "In our view, the substantial increase in the number of shares at a lower par value will provice GCash's operator Mynt the flexibility to issue shares at a more affordable and attractive price to investors. This will make the IPO more accessible to a broader range of investors."\nLast March, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved a proposal made by the PSE to exempt giant initial public offerings such as that of GCash from the 20 percent minimum public float requirement.\n“We have been able to get an approval from the SEC where companies that want to offer ₱5 billion pesos or more, can actually offer less than 20 percent,” said PSE President and CEO Ramon S. Monzon.\nHe added that, under the exemption, “They can offer 15 percent with a commitment that they will do a follow-on offering or a private placement in the next two or three years to comply in the 20 percent requirement.”\nMynt has been asking for an exemption from the rule, considering that the stock market is currently having liquidity problems and may not be able to absorb its IPO if they are required to offer 20 percent of its outstanding shares.\nThe company said earlier that it will seek a valuation of $8 billion when it goes public, possibly by year-end. This would value a 20 percent IPO at $1.6 billion.\nWhile the fintech is gearing up for an IPO, the company said market conditions need to be right, and they're not in a hurry to do an IPO. Additionally, it believes that the current minimum float of 20 percent is too high and that a float of 10 percent to 15 percent would be ideal.\nThis would value the IPO at $800 million to $1.2 billion--just below the $1.3 billion IPO of Monde Nissin Corporation, which is historically the biggest IPO in the Philippine stock market. However, in peso terms, this will be bigger than the ₱48.6 billion raised by Monde Nissin.\n“Even at the low point of this range, an $800 million offering could be the country's biggest ever,” noted Abacus Securities Corporation.\nIt added that, “In our view, the listing is likely to push through even if conditions are not ideal. Investors are hungry for quality IPOs... Also, waiting too long would risk turning Mynt's investment thesis stale... Bottom line, Mynt will have to list soon if management wants to extract the best value.

electricity-spot-market-sees-double-digit-price-drop-in-may	Electricity spot market sees double-digit price drop in May	The Independent Electricity Market Operator of the Philippines (IEMOP) announced an 11 percent drop in Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) prices in May.\nIEMOP data, released on Tuesday, June 3, showed that the average price eased to ₱4.01 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), while the system supply increased by four percent to 22,218 megawatts (MW).\nAccording to IEMOP, the continued heat during the billing period drove the increase in overall system demand.\n“The price trend from April to May 2025 showed a decline, in contrast to the same period in 2024, where prices increased. This difference was due to a higher supply margin in May 2025,” IEMOP stated.\nSimilarly, alongside the large average supply, demand grew by 2.9 percent to 15,169 MW throughout the month.\nAmong the three regions, Mindanao experienced the largest spot market price drop at 24.3 percent to ₱3.11/kWh. Visayas also saw a 17.9 percent WESM price decline to ₱3.71/kWh.\nLuzon, despite having the smallest decrease in May, still saw a 7.9 percent slowdown in its spot market prices at ₱4.23/kWh.\nLuzon's supply and demand both increased this month, reaching 15,620 MW and 10,993 MW, respectively.\nVisayas’ demand rose to 2,078 MW, while its supply increased to 2,664 MW.\nMindanao, on the other hand, saw its demand ease down to 2,098 MW, but its supply expanded by four percent to 3,934 MW.\nRegarding the overall generation mix, coal power's share slightly increased to 59.9 percent in the previous billing period, while renewable energy (RE) contributed 22 percent.\nNatural gas maintained a 17 percent share, while oil-based power declined to 0.4 percent.\nHydropower generation jumped to 7.7 percent in May, offsetting the downward trend experienced last January.\nSolar power generation, however, decreased from 4.8 percent to 4.6 percent.

ffcccii-calls-for-99-year-land-lease-law-to-boost-philippine-investments	FFCCCII calls for 99-year land lease law to boost Philippine investments	The Federation of Filipino Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Inc. (FFCCCII) is strongly urging Congress to pass the 99-year land lease bill, viewing it as a historic opportunity to transform the nation into a leading investment powerhouse in Asia. In a statement on Wednesday, June 4,  Victor Y. Lim, FFCCCII president, said the reform is crucial for elevating the Philippines' global competitiveness, attracting significant foreign direct investment (FDI), and ensuring long-term economic prosperity. \nAccording to the FFCCCII, the proposed bill is not merely a policy adjustment but a strategic leap forward, aligning the Philippines with the economic models of dynamic Asian economies. \nThe organization noted that progressive nations such as Singapore (with 99-year leases), Malaysia (99 years), and Indonesia (95 years) have successfully leveraged long-term land leases to fuel substantial growth in various sectors, including finance, technology, manufacturing, renewable energy, and agro-industry. \nADVERTISEMENT\nThe FFCCCII cited China's Shenzhen, which transformed from a fishing village into a trillion-dollar tech and tourism hub, as another example of this proven model. Investors, the FFCCCII added, demand stability, which 99-year leases would provide.\nThe FFCCCII further explained that the passage of this reform is expected to unlock multi-billion-dollar investments across key sectors. \nThese include advanced manufacturing, with potential for semiconductor plants and electric vehicle factories; tourism and infrastructure, through world-class resorts, smart cities, and logistics hubs; agro-industrial growth, leading to global-scale food processing and export zones; and renewable energy, encompassing solar, wind, and green hydrogen projects. \nThe organization stated that the ripple effect of these investments would generate millions of high-quality jobs, strengthen micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and increase tax revenues, which could then be allocated to improve infrastructure, healthcare, and education.\nADVERTISEMENT\nTo ensure responsible growth and protect national interests, the FFCCCII noted that the bill includes strict provisions. \nThese safeguards comprise oversight by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)-Board of Investments (BOI)/Investment Promotion Agencies (IPA) to ensure leases align with national development goals, anti-speculation measures requiring projects to commence within three years, compliance with agrarian reform to protect farmlands, and heavy penalties of up to P10 million for violations. \nThe FFCCCII said that the Philippines can attract significant investments while maintaining sovereignty, similar to Singapore and Hong Kong. \nThe time to act, the FFCCCII emphasized, is now, as global capital flows to welcoming policy environments, and the Philippines cannot afford hesitation while other nations aggressively court investors.

dbp-net-income-surges-82-in-q1-on-strong-lending	DBP net income surges 82% in Q1 on strong lending	State-run Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) reported that its net income surged to ₱1.61-billion in the first quarter of the year, an 82 percent increase from a year earlier due to intensified lending activities in its priority sectors and key industries.\nIn a statement, DBP President and Chief Executive Officer Michael O. de Jesus. De Jesus noted that the significant increase in interest income from bank’s lending and investment portfolio primarily drove this resurgence.\nHe added that DBP’s strong financial performance in the first quarter reflected the local banking industry's robust performance, which has greatly benefited from the stable macroeconomic environment brought about by the sound economic policies of President Marcos.\nAs the 10th largest bank in the country by assets, DBP provides credit support to four economic sectors: infrastructure and logistics; micro, small, and medium enterprises; the environment; and social services and community development. \nThe bank operates a network of 150 branches, including 14 branch-lite units strategically located in underserved areas across the country.\nDe Jesus stated that DBP’s total assets surpassed the trillion-peso mark, reaching ₱1.04-trillion, a seven percent increase from ₱977-billion recorded in March 2024. \nHe added that the bank’s net worth also saw an 11 percent rise, standing at ₱97-billion compared to ₱87-billion during the same period last year. Total deposits grew to ₱821-billion, a nine percent year-on-year increase from ₱756-billion, while loans to borrowers rose by two percent to ₱519-billion from ₱509-billion.\nAccording to de Jesus, approximately 60 percent of DBP’s total loans, or ₱314.7-billion, were channeled into the infrastructure and logistics sector, with the majority of projects situated in the National Capital Region, Central Luzon, Davao, Eastern Visayas, and Central Visayas. \nHe further noted that DBP allocated ₱96.7-billion for social infrastructure and community development projects, ₱47-billion for environment-related initiatives, and ₱25-billion for micro, small, and medium enterprises.\nDe Jesus assured that the bank will continue to aggressively pursue programs supporting the National Government’s economic agenda, particularly those promoting infrastructure development, food sufficiency, and energy security, while remaining responsive to client banking needs. \nHe also expects another banner year for the bank given the favorable economic landscape, as DBP pursues more programs and initiatives contributing positively towards the "deep economic and social transformation as embodied in the Philippine Development Plan, 2023 to 2028."

election-results-reflect-what-people-need	Election results reflect what people need	In a humbled demeanor, President Ferdinand Marcos acknowledged that the 5-5-2 Senate results were somewhat of a rebuke to certain government policies and highlighted what people need. Marcos stated, "People are tired of politics," and that the government had been too focused on mega-infrastructure projects, neglecting the smaller issues that "affect people's lives." The President was accurate in his assessment.\nPremier communication strategist Alan German more graphically articulated his point: the front-runners in the 2025 Senate race employed a single-messaging strategy that expressed what people truly need. Bong Go (health), Bam Aquino (education), Bato de la Rosa (peace and order), Erwin Tulfo (social services), and Kiko Pangilinan (food-agriculture) finished as the top five winners among the twelve.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn health, the "Malasakit" program (of Go), intended to unify Philhealth, Pag-ibig, and other government "ayuda" (aid), was regrettably bastardized and politicized by government officials. This adversely affected people on the opposing side of the politicians in power in their communities.\nWhile education may be free in public schools, the reality is that 15 million Filipino students are "functionally illiterate" due to poor education quality, hindering their ability to find employment and eroding our human capital.\nCorruption and inefficiency (red tape) continue to plague all levels of government, down to the barangays, making social services difficult or expensive to access. The "ayuda" system is marred by political intervention and a weak distribution network. Concurrently, the drug problem has re-emerged with a vengeance.\nMeanwhile, 50 percent of Filipinos self-rated themselves as "hungry," underscoring the severity of food inflation in the country.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMarcos, non-confrontational by nature, is slow to anger and a pacifist. However, at times, treating governance with kid gloves can be counterproductive. Is the fault, in the stars, Brutus?\nAlready, the president has refrained from open involvement in the controversial "charter change" through people's initiative and the formulation of the national budget. Unlike various past administrations, Marcos' Budget (called the NEP - National Expenditure Program) for the last three years has been at the mercy of cutting and realignment by the Bicameral Group, with many tagging the 2025 national budget as "the most corrupt."\nDespite the merciless badgering by the Duterte group, Marcos still extends an olive branch of peace, stating, "because I want stability so we can move forward." His Pontius Pilate act of washing his hands over the impeachment moves against VP Sara and the ICC's arrest of President Duterte is, to us, conduct not expected of a true president. He should simply declare that we are a nation of laws and let the sword of Lady Justice fall where it should. Besides, the UNITEAM is a thing of the past, and no amount of cajoling, much less fawning at the enemy, will ever change that. There is absolutely no need to appear like a scarecrow when you are the head of 115 million people.\nOn the other hand, Marcos's moves to rearrange his Cabinet and remove the heads of the environment, housing, solicitor general, OFWs, and foreign affairs agencies are steps in the right direction. He should dismiss more. And review the COA (Commission on Audit) reports on the performance of many GOCCs (government-owned and controlled corporations), and remove the corrupt and laggard entities within them. Many of these companies, in any case, are a drain on the country's fiscal health.\nReports even from remote provinces indicate that the number and value of drugs busted are unprecedented and alarming. Newly appointed PNP head Major Gen. Nicanor Torre III should increase police visibility and apprehend the "Big Fish" instead of targeting small users.\nMarcos should also heed Senator-elect Ping Lacson's plan to review the "graft-laden" 2025 GAA (General Appropriations Act) and rectify those aspects tenable under our laws. He should find ways to realign some funds to bolster what has been previously reduced from critical sectors like health, education, and national defense agency budgets.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSince rice is a staple food for Filipinos, BBM should find a permanent source of subsidy to make cheap rice available (₱20/kilo) rather than siphoning funds from contingency reserves. This specific problem, which gnaws at the stomachs of the people, does not need palliatives. Likewise, there is a need to strengthen RA 12022, the Anti-Agricultural Sabotage Law, and prosecute rice smugglers, hoarders, and price manipulators. The criminals are known, but sufficient political will is needed to jail them.\nIt is ironic that, with 7,000 islands, fish prices remain prohibitive, considering that it was once the Filipinos' main dish. Why? It is also appropriate to reinstate the maximum Suggested Retail Price (SRP) of pork to ₱350 to ₱380 per kilo by August in response to the drawbacks of the ASF (African Swine Fever).\nMarcos has three short years until 2028. He should buckle down to serious business, and if not to leave a lasting positive legacy to the nation, then to partially redeem the name of his family that has been accused of plundering the nation to penury.\n(Bingo Dejaresco, a former banker, is a financial consultant, media practitioner, and author.

Top Senate winners focused on health, education, peace and order, social services, and food security, reflecting public priorities.  Corruption and inefficiency plague government services, impacting access to aid and exacerbating problems like food inflation and the drug crisis.

connecting-leaders-in-a-disconnected-world	Connecting leaders in a disconnected world	VANCOUVER, Canada – The Philippine Independence Day celebration in the Pacific Northwest province of British Columbia is muted this year because of the Lapu-Lapu Festival tragedy here last April. Metro Vancouver has the second-largest Filipino community in Canada next to Greater Toronto, and the Fil-Canadians are  regarded as a significant demographic in this city's multicultural landscape.\nHyatt Regency Vancouver hosted the just-concluded 2025 World Conference of the International Association of Business Communicators (IABC) with hundreds of delegates from around the globe. “Connect!” was the theme of this year’s conference, since the ability to connect has never been more crucial in the ever-evolving landscape of business communications. Keynote speakers were Google’s Chief Strategist Neil Horne and the University of Southern California’s Center for Public Relations Director Fred Cook.\nHighlighting the four-day convention was the recognition ceremony of the IABC Gold Quill Awards, the Oscars of the communications profession. Four Philippine-based organizations won the Gold Quills for 2025, namely: Bases Conversion and Development Authority, Energy Development Corp., Media Wise Communications Inc., and Megaworld Foundation. Media Wise published the winning autobiography of RCBC President and CEO Eugene Acevedo titled Never Stand Alone.\nADVERTISEMENT\nTalk of the town was the spectacular collapse of US President Donald Trump’s relationship with his senior advisor Elon Musk, former head of the Department of Government Efficiency. Last week, their fractured alliance exploded on social media and rapidly escalated into a very public feud. What happens next remains unclear, but this is clearly a nightmare for the publicists of both alpha-male leaders.\nAnother topic of conversation among the Asian delegates was the recent Shangri-La Dialogue 2025 in Singapore. Many defense ministers and military chiefs of mostly European and Asia-Pacific nations participate in this annual dialogue. In his speech, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth urged his Asian counterparts to raise defense spending to 5 percent of their gross domestic product (GDP) to match the levels that the US expects from its European allies. \nRepresentatives of American weapons manufacturing firms and defense contractors were part of the US delegation to the global forum in the Lion City. It seems that Hegseth did not participate in the dialogue to discuss diplomacy or promote peace in this part of the world. He acted more as a salesman for the US military-industrial complex.\nWhy didn't he call for an increase in infrastructure spending or education budgets? In the Philippines, where the involuntary hunger rate is at its highest since the pandemic, spending 5 percent of our GDP on defense to prepare for a war not of our own making is unconscionable. For a country gripped by poverty and inequality, it would be irresponsible to allocate that much on weapons of war -- oblivious to the plight of ordinary Filipinos who struggle to survive every single day.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBy end-2025, Philippine GDP is projected to reach ₱27.8 trillion, while the national budget approved by Congress for this year amounts to ₱6.3 trillion. If we follow Hegseth's recommendation, we would be spending 21.9 percent of the country's annual budget on defense alone!\nMeanwhile, as our defense officials were shaking the hands of their American counterparts in the Singapore dialogue, hundreds of thousands of hardworking Filipinos in the US are at risk of being deported. Is this the way to treat one's allies? Why do our officials allow this?\nBefore the midterm elections last month, the latest SWS survey showed that job creation, food security, and adequate healthcare are the top concerns of Filipinos. Yet finding jobs has become more difficult nowadays, and crimes have become more rampant even in affluent areas such as the central business districts of Makati and Taguig. Based on the 2025 Numbeo Crime Index, Manila and Quezon City ranked 2nd and 3rd, respectively, on the list of the top 15 Asian cities with the highest crime rate.\nWill spending a trillion pesos on defense create jobs for millions of unemployed Filipinos, and would it put more affordable food on our tables? Our leaders should be more discerning and circumspect—otherwise the future generations will have to pay for the misguided decisions they make today.\nJ.

firb-approves-21-billion-in-tax-relief-for-govt-institutions	FIRB approves ₱21 billion in tax relief for gov't institutions	The Fiscal Incentives Review Board (FIRB) has approved nearly ₱21 billion in tax subsidies requested by 10 government institutions, exempting these agencies from paying taxes and duties.\nAs of May 21, the FIRB, chaired by Finance Secretary Ralph G. Recto, has approved ₱20.9 billion in tax subsidy applications for the fiscal years (FY) 2024 and 2025. The Department of Finance (DOF) stated that these approvals aim to make public services "more accessible and efficient for Filipinos."\nRecto also said that this decision aligns with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s "commitment to delivering more responsive public services." He added, "This tax subsidy will help to expedite and expand the services of government agencies for the people."\nAccording to the Special Allotment Release Order (SARO), all approved agencies have fully utilized their tax subsidies in previous fiscal years.\nFor 2024, the government approved tax subsidies for key agencies, including ₱7.5 billion for the Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA), ₱6 billion for the National Power Corporation (NPC), ₱4.5 billion for the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC), and ₱2 billion for the National Transmission Commission (TransCo).\nAlso included were the Armed Forces of the Philippines Commissary and Exchange Service (AFPCES) with ₱305 million, the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) with ₱223 million, and the University of the Philippines (UP) National Institute of Physics with ₱6.6 million.\nFor 2025, the BTR has also been granted tax subsidies amounting to ₱223.2 million and AFPCES with ₱58.5 million.\nGovernment agencies whose tax subsidy applications have been approved will no longer have to pay taxes and duties for the covered fiscal years.\nThis approach would enable the agencies to “focus their resources on delivering better and more efficient public services,” the DOF said.\nThe FIRB is authorized by law to approve tax subsidy applications of government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs), government instrumentalities, government commissaries, and state universities and colleges (SUCs) to support public institutions in fulfilling their missions without being burdened by tax obligations.

da-eyes-gradual-return-of-rice-import-tariff-to-35	DA eyes gradual return of rice import tariff to 35%	The Department of Agriculture (DA) is in support of a recommendation from a House of Representatives panel to revert the rice tariff rate from 15 percent to 35 percent—on the condition that this will be implemented gradually.\nDuring the final hearing of the House quinta committee on Wednesday, June 11, among its recommendations is to raise the tariff rate to its previous level, citing the need to safeguard local farmers from the entry of rice imports.\nAgriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel said the agency is open to such a proposal but noted that the increase should be done in phases to minimize its impact on the rice market.\n“Our suggestion is a gradual increase...eventually returning to the 35-percent duty,” he said during the hearing.\nLaurel warned that an immediate hike in the rice import duty could disrupt the global rice trade, potentially driving up prices of the staple.\nAs the world’s largest rice importer, the Philippines plays a crucial role in shaping global rice prices over its demand and supply, and even policy shifts.\nThe United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) earlier projected that the country’s rice imports will rise to 5.5 million metric tons (MT) in the upcoming market year, exceeding the record-high of 4.8 million MT in 2024.\nLaurel said he has since recommended to the Tariff Commission, the agency tasked to recommend and develop tariff policies, to ensure that future increases in the rice tariffs are implemented on a gradual basis.\nLast year, President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. signed Executive Order (EO) No. 62 to slash rice tariffs from 35 percent to 15 percent in a move to tame rice prices.\nUnder EO 62, the rate is subject to review every four months.\nCutting the rice tariff, alongside initiatives such as the maximum suggested retail price (MSRP), has seen prices of the commodity go down, contributing to the slowdown of inflation.\nAgriculture groups, however, pointed out that lowering the tariff rate threatens the livelihood of farmers due to the influx of rice imports, with the government also losing billions of pesos in foregone revenues.\nLast month, Laurel said the government would likely push for the retention of the 15-percent tariff rate in its scheduled review this month to avoid potential price increases.\nHe explained that raising the duty should coincide with the harvest seasons of the country’s major suppliers.\nVietnam, the largest supplier of rice to the Philippines, will have its harvest season around late September. Pakistan, another top exporter, is scheduled to harvest in December.	"\\tImages/da-eyes-gradual-return-of-rice-import-tariff-to-35_1.png"	The Department of Agriculture supports a gradual increase in rice import tariffs from 15% to 35%, aiming to protect local farmers.  A sudden increase could disrupt global rice trade and raise prices.  Lowering tariffs previously helped tame inflation, but threatened farmers' livelihoods.  The government plans a phased approach, coordinating tariff hikes with harvest seasons.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/12/da-eyes-gradual-return-of-rice-import-tariff-to-35
first-gen-expands-renewable-energy-focus-beyond-geothermal	First Gen expands renewable energy focus beyond geothermal	Lopez-led First Gen Corporation (First Gen) is set to expand its renewable energy initiatives beyond geothermal, with plans to increase investments in solar and wind technologies.\nIn a recent interview, First Gen President and Chief Operating Officer Francis Giles Puno said the company's strategy is to balance its established geothermal production with new solar and wind developments. \n"Our focus has been more on geothermal, because [it] can run base load. So it produces more kilowatt-hours (kWh) every hour," Puno told reporters.\nTo achieve the same level of electricity production as a geothermal plant, Puno said First Gen needs to significantly increase its investment in solar and wind, as these sources are currently on a smaller scale for the firm.\nFirst Gen is already moving forward with the Inara project, a 50-megawatt (MW) solar facility in Batangas, with plans to potentially increase its capacity to 100 MW. Puno estimates the initial phase of the Inara project will cost approximately $20 million (around ₱1 billion).\n“That’s the reason why this year, we’re setting up our first larger solar scale project, 50 MW first phase. Hopefully, 150 [MW]… That’s the start of our buildout of solar,” he said.\nHe also said that the company is currently securing permits for the project and expects to spend $20 to $25 million this year, though the project won't be completed until next year.\nFurther demonstrating its commitment to solar energy, First Gen acquired full ownership of Pi Energy Inc. in May for ₱1 billion. This acquisition included 210,330 common shares and 2.78 million preferred shares. Pi Energy is known for its expertise in microgrids, solar rooftops, energy audits, remote energy monitoring, and energy efficiency services. It was previously a subsidiary of Renewable Energy (RE) firm First Philippine Holdings Corp. (FPH).\n"In the meantime, the feasibility for wind is also promising," Puno noted. "We're hoping to expand in Burgos, Ilocos Norte, and other areas where we have concessions.”\nFirst Gen's subsidiary, Energy Development Corporation (EDC), currently manages the EDC Burgos Wind Power Corp. (EBWPC).\nEBWPC owns and operates the 150 MW Burgos Wind project in Ilocos Norte, which spans a 600-hectare site and is connected via a 115-kilovolt (kV) transmission line linking the wind farm from the Burgos substation to the Laoag substation and associated switchyards.

deposit-insurance-not-enough-to-prevent-bank-runs-bsp	Deposit insurance not enough to prevent bank runs—BSP	Even with the safety net of deposit insurance, both small and large depositors tend to pull out their funds when a nearby bank shuts down, suggesting that fear of losing access to cash outweighs the assurance of protection, according to a study co-authored by top Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) officials.\n“A bank closure does lead to significant withdrawals by depositors at other banks in the vicinity,” said in a study titled “Do small bank deposits run more than large ones? Three event studies of contagion and financial inclusion” published authored by BSP Governor Eli M. Remolona, Jr., BSP Senior Assistant Governor Johnny Noe E. Ravalo, and UP Professor Emeritus Dante B. Canlas.\nAmong the major findings was the widespread withdrawal of funds before a suspected bank’s closure. This comes despite the safety net provided by deposit insurance to depositors.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Their withdrawal is suggestive that their fear of a loss in liquidity, even if this is temporary in principle, outweighs the assurance of the insurance,” the authors argued.\nThey further noted that in terms of behavior, “while a large bank failure can lead to contagion, small and large depositors do not behave that differently.” This means that, generally, if both small and large depositors were well informed, there would be a similar reaction towards bank closure in the vicinity.\n“Financial inclusion in the form of access to bank deposits is not likely to add to instability to the banking system, but it is not likely to reduce instability either,” the authors said.\nBanks benefit from having “sticky deposits,” or those that tend to stay put, but this stability comes at a cost.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe authors noted that paying for deposit insurance helps keep banks in check by discouraging risky behavior.\n“Yet again, there appears to be a market for information that allows both small and large depositors to withdraw early,” they added.\n“All these are suggestive that while deposit insurance provides reinforcing effects, it also does not prevent runs in the presence of local adverse information of possible bank stress,” they said.\nThe BSP-attached deposit insurer, the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC), doubled its insurance coverage for bank deposits from ₱500,000 previously to ₱1 million per depositor per bank, effective March 15.\nAccording to the PDIC, the maximum coverage hike was approved by its board of directors “to provide enhanced protection and more confidence for the depositing public.”\nOn May 21, the state deposit insurer expanded this ₱1 million coverage to Islamic banks (IBs) and Islamic banking units (IBUs).\nADVERTISEMENT	"\\tImages/deposit-insurance-not-enough-to-prevent-bank-runsbsp_1.png"	A study by BSP officials reveals that even with deposit insurance, bank closures cause widespread withdrawals from nearby banks, driven by fear of liquidity loss.  Depositors, both small and large, react similarly to such events, suggesting that information about potential bank stress overrides insurance assurance.  While deposit insurance discourages risky bank behavior, it doesn't prevent runs fueled by fear.  The PDIC recently doubled its deposit insurance coverage to ₱1 million.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/10/deposit-insurance-not-enough-to-prevent-bank-runsbsp

govt-borrows-above-target-286-billion-as-investors-lock-in-rates-before-expected-drop	Gov't borrows above-target ₱28.6 billion as investors lock in rates before expected drop	The government on Monday, June 2, borrowed ₱28.6 billion—exceeding its ₱25-billion offer—through short-term debt papers as domestic lenders flocked to the sale, eager to lock in relatively higher interest rates ahead of an expected decline in the coming months.\nAt the latest treasury bills auction, the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) awarded more than its planned borrowing, with total bids reaching ₱116.3 billion—nearly five times the amount offered.\nThis week’s total bids were significantly higher than the ₱84.3 billion in tenders from the previous T-bill auction on May 26.\nThe government fully awarded the ₱8-billion offering for 91-day T-bills. Total tenders reached ₱31.7 billion. The average rate was 5.452 percent, 1.6 basis points (bps) lower than the previous week’s 5.468-percent rate.\nFor 182-day debt papers, the BTr also raised ₱8 billion, fully awarding the offered amount. Bids reached ₱41.7 billion. It fetched an average rate of 5.565 percent, slightly higher by 1.4 bps than last week’s 5.551 percent.\nNotably, the BTr borrowed more than the planned ₱9 billion through 364-day IOUs, raising ₱12.6 billion. Demand reached ₱43 billion. The average rate dropped slightly by 1.4 percent to 5.68 from 5.694 percent in the previous auction.\nPrior to Monday’s auction, PHP Bloomberg Valuation (PHP BVAL) Reference Rates showed that the 91-, 182-, and 364-day T-bills were quoted at 5.433 percent, 5.597 percent, and 5.725 percent, respectively. Rates across the board slightly dipped from last week’s benchmark rate.\nNotably, only the three-month IOUs were higher than the official benchmark. The six-month and one-year debt papers, meanwhile, were lower than the benchmark rate.\nThe average rate for three-month T-bills clocked in lower than the key borrowing costs of 5.5 percent. Meanwhile, longer-dated IOUs stood higher than the benchmark.\nRizal Commercial Banking Corp. (RCBC) chief economist Michael Ricafort said that the higher demand from short-term debt papers could be attributed to the investors’ move of locking in relatively higher interest rates “before they go down in the coming months.”\nHe also said that reduced interest rates for T-bills reflected a modest decline in comparable short-term PHP BVAL yields, a movement that comes ahead of the data on May inflation. The market widely expects further easing in inflation from 1.4 percent in April.\nRicafort noted that a further drop in inflation could bolster the case for a possible quarter-point rate cut during the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas' (BSP) next policy meeting on June 19, which is in line with recent signals from BSP Governor Eli M. Remolona Jr.—the likelihood of two more cuts for the rest of 2025.\nThe Philippines borrows more locally—through treasury bills and bonds—than from foreign sources. This borrowing strategy takes advantage of domestic banks and creditors who are awash in cash, while veering away from foreign exchange (forex) risks and volatility.\nThe national government’s outstanding debt was equivalent to 62 percent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter—its highest level in two years. It climbed from 60.7 percent at the end of 2024.\nSpecifically, domestic debt stood at 42.3 percent of GDP, while foreign debt had a GDP ratio of 19.7 percent.

Domestic lenders rushed to lock in higher interest rates before an expected decline.  Total bids reached ₱116.3 billion, nearly five times the offered amount.  Reduced interest rates reflect a modest decline in short-term yields, anticipating lower inflation.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/02/govt-borrows-above-target-285-billion-as-investors-lock-in-rates-before-expected-drop
emperador-optimistic-of-recovery-in-whisky-business-amid-global-cyclical-slowdown	Emperador optimistic of recovery in whisky business amid global 'cyclical' slowdown	While its whisky business currently faces challenges resulting in lower sales and earnings, global liquor conglomerate Emperador Inc. continues to expand its facilities as it is optimistic of a turnaround and looks forward to a growing market over the medium to long term.\n“We are seeing a slowdown in the whisky business across the world: in North America, in China, and even in Europe. The market has become very competitive given the situation. We believe, however, that this is cyclical,” said Emperador Chairman and President Winston Co during the firm’s annual stockholders’ meeting.\nHe added that, “We believe that, eventually, the Scotch whisky business should return to growth. And we are hoping that, by next year, starting 2026, there should be a resurgence and a rebound back to regular consumption.”\nCo explained that sales in the Scotch whisky market, particularly for single malt, are doing well, but it is the premium, high-end segment that is affected.\n“But we believe that consumption should continue, and the long-term prospect of the Scotch whisky and the single-malt whisky continues to be attractive over the long-term period,” he noted.\nWhile tariff issues are also creating uncertainties of whisky exports to the United States (US), Co said Emperador is looking at fresh opportunities elsewhere, such as India, where whisky taxes have been reduced by 50 percent.\n“So we expect a surge in the importation of Scotch whisky into India. While it will not happen immediately, all players are positioning to capitalize on this opportunity and we are working with our distributors in India,” he said.\nCo reiterated that Emperador is optimistic over the long-term and “looking at five years from today, we are very excited. We believe that the global business will continue to grow next year…and all global reports indicate that there will be a continuous growth following this year on a global basis.”\nBecause of this, Co said Emperador is set to spend ₱4 billion this year, with the bulk going into its whisky business. This is mostly for the ongoing expansion of its Dalmore distillery, which is set to be completed in the second half of this year.\n“We are almost at the completion of the Dalmore distillery expansion in Alness, Scotland. This is envisioned to double the brand’s production capacity while also providing a new visitor experience,” said Co.\nIn addition, there is also an expansion of the whisky maturation complex at Emperador’s Invergordon distillery, doubling its footprint from 45.4 hectares (ha) to 92 ha. This will enable the grain distillery to house an additional 1.5 million casks of maturing whisky.\nCo added that, “All this effort will ensure the capability of the whisky business to meet greater global demand for single malt and blended whiskies in the long term.”\nMeanwhile, after the firm’s annual stockholders’ meeting, tycoon Andrew Tan was elected chairman emeritus, while Co was named chairman and president. Glenn D. Manlapaz was elected chief executive officer (CEO), while Kendrick Andrew L. Tan was named executive director.

crec-ups-2025-capex-to-1-billion	CREC ups 2025 capex to $1 billion	Renewable energy (RE) developer Citicore Renewable Energy Corp. (CREC) has earmarked an even higher capital expenditures (capex) allocation for this year to support the goal to achieve its capacity-building projects for 2025.\nDuring the company’s annual stockholders’ meeting (ASM) on Monday, June 9, Oliver Tan, president and chief executive officer (CEO), disclosed that their capex budget for this year has increased compared to figures in 2024.\n“Total capex would roughly be north of $1 billion (approximately ₱55.8 billion). Most of them has already been spent [in the] early parts of the year for the one gigawatt (GW) before the end of the year,” he said.\nEarlier this year, Tan shared that CREC spent around ₱35 billion on its RE projects in 2024.\nThe CREC chief also mentioned during the ASM that the second batch of spending will be done towards the second half of the year, in line with the goal to energize an additional one GW of capacity, which would contribute to the company’s roadmap of five GW in the next five years.\nMost of the expected projects to be energized this year have been included in the Department of Energy’s (DOE) second green energy auction (GEA-2) in 2023.\nAdditionally, he expressed that CREC’s soon-to-be completed solar plants with infused battery energy storage systems (BESS) would further expand their market share.\n“We hope that our investors, our stakeholders, and our communities continue working and believing in us to reach our vision of powering a first-world Philippines with pure RE,” Tan said in his speech.\nMeanwhile, its RE real estate investment firm, Citicore Energy REIT Corp. (CREIT), assured the acquisition of new solar operating assets from CREC toward the end of the year.\n“Once these RE facilities are online, we expect to surge in tandem with CREC, further giving merit to our value-accretive strategy,” Tan said in a separate ASM.\n“As we continue our asset expansion, we aim to provide a more significant income acceleration to empower your investments and leave a positive impact on our communities and the environment,” he added.

creit-plans-new-fundraising-in-2026-for-solar-farm-expansion	CREIT plans new fundraising in 2026 for solar farm expansion	Citicore Energy REIT Corporation, the country’s first renewable energy real estate investment trust, is considering raising new funds next year to finance the acquisition of additional land for the expansion of its solar farm portfolio.\nDuring the firm’s annual stockholders’ meeting, CREIT President and CEO Oliver Tan said, “Any new land acquisition would involve new fundraising, we are looking at around next year.”\nHe explained that this is because “we already fully deployed the (proceeds) of the green bond that we raised two years ago” adding that they intend to acquire more land for the second gigawatt of sponsor Citicore Renewable Energy Corporation’s (CREC)five-year target of one gigawatt per year.\n“We will first complete the acquisition of the batch of 250 megawatts of solar assets before the end of the year before any plans of acquiring new properties,” noted Tan.\nThe latest batch to be acquired from CREC will not involve any land but will be purely for the solar plant facilities, since the land where the solar assets were developed is already owned by CREIT.\nMeanwhile, Tan said that the first batch of solar assets being built on land that CREIT acquired in 2023 will be operational by the third or fourth quarter of this year, as part of CREC’s goal of energizing approximately one gigawatt worth of new solar facilities by the end of 2025.\nDuring the meeting, CREIT Chairman Edgar Saavedra stressed that, “Our land assets, which are primed to support such (renewable energy) developments, are an attractive opportunity for investors.\nTan, meanwhile, underscored the company’s vision to be the foremost Energy REIT investment in the Philippines, delivering superior yields from a portfolio of sustainable prime land and solar assets.\n“Our accomplishments translated positively to our investors through record high dividends, and to our host communities through sustainability programs conducted with the Citicore Group,” Tan said.\nCREIT felt the full impact of its asset infusions in 2023, adding seven land parcels totalling 5.12 million square meters. This, combined with an already strong guaranteed base lease and a 48 percent increase on variable lease revenues, translated to a five percent increase in revenues to ₱1.9 billion in 2024. Net income also increased to ₱1.4 billion, while EBITDA grew to ₱1.9 billion.\nAll 14 assets in CREIT’s green portfolio were maintained in 2024, totaling 7.1 million sqm of gross leasable space with a 100-percent occupancy rate year-round and an impressive above-industry-standard weighted average lease expiry (WALE) of 20.44 years as of the end of 2024.

debt-free	Debt free	Being debt-free is truly liberating. You're no longer burdened by repaying principal and interest. Credit card debt is a common trap people fall into. You spend money you don't have on hand, and using your credit card seems like an easy out. In reality, though, this can send you into a financial downward spiral.\nTypical credit card limits are often 20 percent to 30 percent of your annual salary, but this isn't set in stone and can vary widely based on many factors. So, for someone earning ₱50,000 a month (₱600,000 annually), a credit card limit of ₱120,000 is likely reasonable. It wouldn't take much effort to max out that ₱120,000 limit. At a 3.0 percent monthly interest rate, your monthly interest payment would be ₱3,600. That might not seem like much, but it translates to a cost of ₱43,200, or 36.0 percent, a year! Reducing your disposable income by that much means you'll have to make do with less. Can you afford that?\nIt's easy to understand the advantages of avoiding debt, especially if it's for consumption. Of course, there can be valid reasons for borrowing money, such as buying your own home instead of renting, or investing in a business that earns more than the borrowing costs. Medical emergencies can also be a good reason for getting into debt. That said, the big question is: How do we avoid going into debt needlessly? The simplest answer is to live within your means.\nIf your earning capacity is limited, learn to spend no more than you earn and always set aside some savings for contingencies and a rainy day. Know how to prioritize your expenditures and differentiate between necessities and luxuries. Achieving a debt-free life isn't easy, especially at first, as you'll need to make sacrifices by reducing and downgrading your travel, entertainment, and leisure expenses. Your goal shouldn't stop at being debt-free, but rather at building enough savings to make investments that will earn for you in terms of interest, rental income, dividends, and capital gains.\nThe earlier you realize this and become debt-free, the better chance you have to save and invest more to build up your net worth and gain financial independence. It's much better to make those sacrifices and reduce your expenses when you're younger and have the luxury of time. Waiting until you're older will make it more difficult, as you'll have less time to work with, and your ability to adapt to a restricted and more austere lifestyle becomes harder as you age. For sure, making those changes to achieve a debt-free life is worth it!\n(The views and comments of the author are his own and not of the newspaper or FINEX. Dr. George S.

fuel-price-hike-a-wake-up-call-for-philippines-to-accelerate-re-shift	Fuel price hike: A wake-up call for Philippines to accelerate RE shift	The escalating tensions in the Middle East, which are expected to drive up fuel prices significantly, should prompt the Philippines to accelerate its transition to renewable energy (RE), according to a trade envoy.\nGeorge Freeman, the United Kingdom’s (UK) trade envoy to the Philippines, said that whenever a conflict emerges in the Middle East, price volatility is the inevitable outcome, as the region is a major player in the global oil supply.\n“And I know people in the Philippines, people in the UK, may not think that the war in the Middle East is directly affecting them, but it is because it's putting the cost of oil up, the cost of every product that uses oil up,” he said in a media roundtable.\nBased on four days of trading in the global oil market, gasoline prices could rise by ₱2.50 to ₱3.20 per liter next week.\nDiesel prices are also expected to go up by ₱4.30 to as much as ₱4.80 per liter.\nThe Department of Energy (DOE) cited the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran as the cause of this price surge.\nFreeman said that most countries will bear the brunt of the increase in fuel prices, which further necessitates the urgency of shifting to renewable energy sources.\n“If the Philippines is generating more of its own electricity from solar, wind, geothermal, it's much more secure and much less exposed to the price volatility internationally,” the official explained.\n“The renewable transition is key for economic security and prosperity,” he added.\nIn a 2024 report by energy research firm BloombergNEF, the Philippines ranked as the second most attractive emerging hub for renewable energy (RE), only behind India.\nThe report cited the government’s firm commitment in generating clean energy, such as the goal of 35 percent RE in power energy by 2030, as a major contributor to its strong appeal for investors.\nThe Board of Investments (BOI) reported that investments for projects approved by the country’s investment promotion agencies reached a record-high of ₱1.9 trillion in 2024.\nThe RE sector topped all investment sectors with a massive ₱1.30 trillion.\n“By investing in and attracting investment into these industries, you create new, clean jobs,” said Freeman, who previously served as the UK’s minister of state in science, innovation, and technology.\nIn the UK, he said its government aims to harness renewable sources such as wind and solar to make the country no longer dependent on the Middle East for oil.\nFreeman said the UK is ready to provide some help to the Philippines in this regard through Octopus Energy, which has expressed interest in expanding in the Philippines.\nOctopus Energy, the UK’s biggest energy supplier, is among the major players leading the European nation’s renewable transition.\n“We’re investing heavily, and we want to bring that expertise here and to help the Philippines so that in 20 to 30 years, the Philippines isn't reliant on coal and isn't exposed to the same geopolitical supply chain risks,” Freeman said.\nIn 2024, the UK was the largest single investor in the Philippines, driven by investments in the RE sector.	"\\tImages/fuel-price-hike-a-wake-up-call-for-philippines-to-accelerate-re-shift_1.png"	Rising Middle East tensions are driving up fuel prices in the Philippines, highlighting the urgency of transitioning to renewable energy.  The country's strong commitment to clean energy and significant investments in renewable energy projects make it an attractive hub for investors.  The UK, a major investor in Philippine renewable energy, offers expertise and support for this shift.

Coinciding with the opening of classes, students can now avail of the smaller fare across Light Rail Transit Line 1 (LRT-1), LRT-2, and Metro Rail Transit Line 3 (MRT-3) beginning Friday, June 20. The discount, which applies to all students, including those taking postgraduate studies, will be available daily, even during weekends and holidays. This will remain in effect until 2028 or the end of President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.’s term. Malaking tulong ito sa mga pamilya lalo na sa mga magulang na hirap magpa-aral sa kanilang mga anak. 'Yung matitipid nila, pwede nilang ilaan sa ibang gastusin gaya ng mga project, dagdag nila sa baon, o sa iba pang mga gastusin sa school, said Transportation Secretary Vince Dizon. (This is a big help for families, especially parents who are struggling to send their children to school. What they will save, can be used for other expenses like school projects, extra allowance, or other school-related costs.) For LRT-2, which carries the largest student ridership among the three rail lines, the minimum fare is reduced to ₱8. An end-to-end trip from Recto Station in Manila to Antipolo Station in Rizal is now ₱18. In MRT-3, the minimum fare for students stands at ₱6, with an end-to-fare from North Avenue station in Quezon City to Taft Avenue station in Pasay is ₱14. A student commuting via LRT-1 will now pay ₱10 for the minimum fare and ₱28 for the whole stretch of Fernando Poe Jr. station in Quezon City to Dr. Santos station in Parañaque. In a social media post, the DOTr stated that students wishing to avail of the discount must present their school ID from the current school year at the ticket counter. The discount is only valid for single journey tickets, and is not applicable for Beep cards or stored value tickets. The DOTr said the government will subsidize the 50 percent discount for LRT-1. Meanwhile, LRT-2 and MRT-3 will incur revenue losses.

philippines-outpaces-global-averages-in-genai-adoption	Philippines outpaces global averages in GenAI adoption	Businesses are aggressively fostering a digitally confident workforce, with employers making artificial intelligence (AI) a core priority that demands employees acquire AI skills to remain competitive.\nAccording to a study by the online learning platform Coursera, the Philippines has begun laying the groundwork for a digitally confident workforce, with the nation's rapid growth in enrollment in Generative AI (GenAI) courses significantly outpacing the global average.\n“AI is a clear priority for employers, and learners are stepping up by acquiring GenAI skills and industry micro-credentials to stay ahead,” said Eklavya Bhave, Coursera Asia Pacific.\nCoursera recently released its annual Global Skills Report, showing a 383 percent year-on-year increase in GenAI enrollments in the country.\nBhave noted that the Philippines' growth in enrollment far outpaced the Asia Pacific average of 132 percent and even the global average of 195 percent.\n“From AI strategies to forward-thinking education policies, we’re seeing a strong national commitment to equipping Filipinos with the right mix of technical, business, and human skills,” Bhave said.\nAccording to Coursera, this enrollment growth aligns with the Philippines’ efforts to upskill one million AI-skilled workers by 2028, as part of broader digitalization goals. To date, Bhave has stated that 86 percent of Filipino knowledge workers already utilize AI at work, surpassing the global average of 75 percent and the regional average of 83 percent.\nThis trend is also echoed by learner behavior on Coursera, with a sharp rise in enrollments in courses that equip learners with skills employers are prioritizing: AI and ML (up 307 percent), Curiosity (up 74 percent), Customer Service (up 12 percent), and Critical Thinking (up 10 percent).\nAddressing gaps and fostering future growth\nHowever, while GenAI enrollments increased almost fivefold, participation gaps persist, with women comprising only 37 percent of these learners, despite representing 51 percent of Coursera’s overall learner base in the country.\nMeanwhile, demand for job-ready credentials continues to rise in the Philippines, and enrollments in professional certificates grew by 23 percent from the previous year.\nFilipino learners are also building applied tech and digital marketing skills as they prioritize practical skills in software development, IT infrastructure, and campaign management.\nAccording to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025, 96 percent of Filipino businesses aim to upskill their workforce to work effectively alongside AI, surpassing the global average of 77 percent.\nHowever, an International Monetary Fund report stated that 40 percent of jobs in the Philippines are significantly impacted by AI, with 14 percent of the workforce being directly at risk of displacement.\n“Bridging the gap will require coordinated national efforts – including expanding public-private partnerships, integrating micro-credentials into higher education, and scaling online learning access,” Bhave said. “Increasing women’s participation in emerging technology fields will also be critical, not just to achieve gender equality, but to also unlock the full potential of the country’s digital economy,” he added.\nIn Coursera’s Global Skills Report, Filipino learners demonstrated 29 percent proficiency in business, 21 percent in technology, and 17 percent in data science. In Coursera’s AI Maturity Index, the country ranked 60th, indicating promising growth potential in AI research, innovation, and talent development.\nCoursera has 2.7 million learners in the Philippines with a median age of 32, positioning itself as one of the region’s most digitally engaged populations.

However, participation gaps persist, particularly among women, requiring coordinated efforts to bridge the skill gap and unlock the full potential of the digital economy.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/21/philippines-outpaces-global-averages-in-genai-adoption
uniondigital-bank-to-offer-low-interest-loans-under-30000-in-q4-2025	UnionDigital Bank to offer low-interest loans under ₱30,000 in Q4 2025	UnionDigital Bank (UD), the digital bank subsidiary of Aboitiz-led Union Bank of the Philippines is set to launch low-tenor loans under ₱30,000 in the fourth quarter of 2025 as its top executive believes this move is a more disciplined approach to take.\n“We have recently introduced a longer tenor, but Union Digital is going to be concentrated at least in the near future on low tenor loans. Because I think that's the more disciplined way to do,” Danilo Mojica II, UnionDigital Bank’s president and CEO, told reporters on the sidelines of UD’s launch of its digital banking products and services designed to help unbanked Filipinos.\nMojica noted that the smaller loans would target borrowers who need quick, short-term financing.\nCurrently, the digital bank focuses on payroll lending for employees of partner companies, offering loans ranging from ₱30,000 to ₱50,000 with repayment terms of three to nine months, targeting lower-income segments.\nUD has yet to finalize its disbursement target for cash loans this year as it continues to validate the program under its “low and grow” strategy. The digital bank is taking a cautious approach to lending.\nMojica said loan disbursements may be smaller this year under its current strategy, but the focus on disciplined, targeted lending is expected to yield stronger asset quality and profitability compared to last year’s rapid but riskier growth.\n“It is better to be small and profitable than to be big with major NPLs. That is the reason why in the context of a smaller disbursement base, numbers are significantly more disciplined than what they used to be,” Mojica noted.\nMojica said that the digital bank’s soured loans or non-performing loans (NPLs) under its restructured operations since late last year are now within single-digit levels, although this was not disclosed. These are significantly lower than previous figures, following tighter lending discipline and cost controls, he noted.\nUD will further expand its services with the upcoming launch of UD Cash Loans, a streamlined digital loan product that will be made available through the UD app.\nUD’s launch of new products aims to give financial access for the 37.6 million Filipino adults who remain unbanked.\n“It aims to make digital banking, accessible, and empowering—especially for first-time users among sari-sari store owners, ride-sharing drivers, daily wage earners, and informal workers,” UD said in a statement.\nWith first-time borrowers as the target client, the offerings remove the need for collateral and lengthy documentation. It also plans to launch a VISA-powered virtual card for secure online transactions, helping more users join the digital economy.

zero-price-hike-for-poor-as-overall-inflation-drops-to-nearly-six-year-low-1-3-in-may	Zero price hike for poor as overall inflation drops to nearly six-year low 1.3% in May	Consumer price increases slowed further to 1.3 percent in May from 1.4 percent in April, marking the slowest pace in nearly six years, with the poorest households experiencing no increase in overall prices.\nAccording to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), the country’s headline inflation moved at an even slower pace compared to the previous month, which marks the lowest rate since November 2019, when it stood at 1.2 percent.\nMay’s inflation rate fell way below the target band of the government, at two to four percent. Compared to the forecast range of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), last month’s figure clocked in at the midpoint of the 0.9- to 1.7-percent projection.\nPSA Undersecretary and National Statistician Claire Dennis S. Mapa said during a press briefing on Thursday, June 5, that the continued easing of inflation in May was mainly due to the slower price movements in the housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels sub-index.\nIt clocked in at 2.3 percent in May from 2.9 percent in April. In particular, it accounted for 68.4 percent in the overall disinflation.\nAlso driving the slowdown were lower prices in restaurant and accommodation services, a sharper drop in transport costs, and a slight easing in household items and maintenance.\nAs such, the average inflation for the first five months clocked in at 1.9 percent, still below the government’s target band of annual price increases deemed manageable and conductive to economic growth.\nNotably, the bottom 30-percent income households, or the poorest households in the country, had seen no fluctuations in prices in May. This plummeted from 5.3 percent in the same month last year.\nAs early as January, inflation for this segment has already seen a slowdown, with April posting the slightest price hike at only 0.1 percent.\nThe continued drop in May was mainly due to a faster decline in the prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages, which fell by 1.6 percent, compared to a 1.2-percent decrease in April. Food inflation alone massively declined to two percent from 8.2 percent in May a year ago.\nThe Department of Economy, Planning, and Development (DEPDev) said in a statement that this continued decline in nationwide price movements suggests the country’s “progress toward easing price pressures and achieving a more stable cost of living for Filipinos.”\n“We are encouraged by this development. It reflects the success of our sustained efforts to protect the purchasing power of Filipinos and ensure a more affordable cost of living,” said Rosemarie G. Edillon, DEPDev undersecretary for policy and planning.\nFor its part, the BSP noted that the latest headline inflation is “consistent” with the central bank’s outlook of a manageable inflation environment in the months ahead. It can be recalled that the BSP lowered its inflation forecast given the falling commodity prices.\nThe central bank sees a balanced inflation outlook but cited that upside pressures come from “possible increases in transport charges, meat prices, and utility rates.”\nMapa also noted that there are factors that would prompt a reversal of this trend in the coming months, noting that price adjustments in housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels have been notable.\nMeanwhile, potential drivers of continued falling of prices are the persisting effects of “lower tariffs on rice imports and the expected impact of weaker global demand,” the central bank further said.\nRice deflated further by 12.8 percent in May, continuing its trend from 2.3-percent deflation in January, 4.9 percent in February, 7.7 percent in March, and 10.9 percent in April. These averaged to a negative inflation of 7.7 percent for the first five months.\nMapa noted that the market is expecting rice prices to continue declining in the coming months.\nEdillon assured the public that the government remains “committed to executing the necessary measures to keep prices low and stable.” She also said that they are confident about hitting the government’s inflation target for the year.\n“On balance, the more manageable inflation outlook and the downside risks to domestic economic activity allow for a shift toward a more accommodative monetary policy stance,” the BSP said.\n“Looking ahead, the BSP will continue to take a measured approach in deciding on further monetary easing,” it added. The central bank will reassess its monetary policy stance on June 19.\nRecto welcomes low inflation\nDepartment of Finance (DOF) Secretary Ralph G. Recto said that the falling prices is “a very encouraging development and a clear sign that the Marcos Jr. administration’s efforts to stabilize food prices and improve supply chains are paying off, especially for our most vulnerable sectors.”\nRecto noted that the President is “on top of ensuring that we sustain this downward trend.”\n“We will never be complacent. We continue to closely monitor potential sources of price increases—especially now that we are seeing a rise in pork prices. We are working to reverse this by ensuring adequate pork supply and continuing the rollout of the African swine fever (ASF) vaccine,” he added.\nAccording to the DOF, the government’s recent actions—such as enforcing Executive Order (EO) No. 62 and lowering the suggested retail price (SRP) of imported rice to ₱45 per kilo in March—have helped drive this development.\nTo keep inflation slowing down, the DOF said the government is rolling out more programs to make affordable food more accessible, including the newly launched ₱20-per-kilo milled rice to vulnerable groups such as Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) beneficiaries, senior citizens, persons with disabilities (PWDs), and single parents.\nFisherfolk in the West Philippine Sea will also benefit from the program where the government buys their catch and provides fuel and rice subsidies.\nAdditionally, Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Boards (RTWPBs) have been ordered to review and adjust minimum wages based on regional economic conditions, aiming to ensure fair wage hikes that address workers’ needs.

Our focus is not on speculative, high turnover units, but on essential housing for working Filipinos and young families, a segment with sustained demand.\n“While some pockets of oversupply exist, especially in investor-heavy and investor-dependent areas, the broader housing backlog and urban migration trends continue to drive strong need for well-located. affordable homes and, as part of the Megaworld group, Empire East would benefit from group level strategy, while maintaining our unique market niche: building for where real demand exists.”\nMeanwhile, Yu said the company is continuously monitoring developments in issue on US tariffs since it might have an impact on supply chains, the cost of construction materials, and overall investor sentiment.\n“If global uncertainty intensifies, investor confidence may temporarily soften. However, the Philippines remains an attractive alternative for supply chain diversification in Southeast Asia, which could spur more BPO (business process outsourcing) expansion and local demand for housing.\n“We continuously monitor these developments and calibrate our procurement strategies to protect project margins and maintain our competitive pricing,” he said.

In fact, this year, we’re happy to see that we have more site trippings from customers,” he added.\nWhile acknowledging the issue of oversupply, Austria stressed that it is limited to certain areas.\n“It’s been all over the news that there seems to be an oversupply in Metro Manila at least. I agree that there is an oversupply, but the oversupply is only in certain sectors and certain locations. It’s not everywhere,” he said.\nAustria noted that, while interest in condominiums remains strong, many buyers are simply being more careful before making a decision.\n“A lot of people are still eager to buy, but I think affordability issues are out there and also because of the reported oversupply in condo units. Some of the end-users are being more careful, being more cautious, looking at several different properties,” he explained.\nDMCI Homes sees this shift in buyer behavior as a welcome development, pointing to a more discerning market that prioritizes quality and long-term value.\n“And what’s good is that there are a lot of RFO units now and they can see for themselves the quality and value that each developer is offering.\n“And I think that is good for us because we’ve been focusing on improving quality and value for the customer. As we’ve seen in our recently completed projects, the sales have gone up when they were completed because we’re able to bring in the customers and see for themselves the quality and value that we are offering,” Austria said.\nFrom January to May 2025, RFO units accounted for 47 percent of DMCI Homes’ total condominium sales of 1,305 units, a significant jump from 14 percent during the same period in 2024.\nThe company sold 614 RFO units in the first five months of 2025, up from 363 units sold in the same timeframe last year.\nIn terms of value, RFO sales reached ₱4.3 billion, including both units and parking slots—87 percent more than the ₱2.3 billion recorded from January to May 2024.\nLeading RFO sales for the period were Allegra Garden Place in Pasig City and The Crestmont in Quezon City.\nAllegra Garden Place, a two-tower development along Pasig Boulevard, recorded 139 units sold from January to May 2025—up from 81 units sold in the same period last year.\nMeanwhile, The Crestmont along Panay Avenue in Quezon City had 55 units sold during the five-month period, compared to 34 units sold in early 2024.

da-eyes-broader-agri-trade-with-egypt-after-durian-market-access	DA eyes broader agri trade with Egypt after durian market access	The Philippines is looking to export more high-value agricultural products, such as mangoes and bananas, to Egypt after recently gaining market access to the African market for durian.\nDepartment of Agriculture (DA) Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel said he met with Egyptian Ambassador to the Philippines Nader Nabil Zaki last week to explore new opportunities for the country’s top produce.\n“They already granted us access for durian. We are hopeful they will do the same for our mangoes and bananas,” said Laurel in a statement.\nLast month, Egypt finally opened its door to durian exports from the Philippines after nearly two years of negotiations, pest risk assessments, and regulatory cooperation between the two governments.\nThe Bureau of Plant Industry (BPI), an attached agency of the DA, said the entry of the commodity reflects growing confidence of other countries in the Philippines’ plant health and safety systems.\nIn exchange for the market access for durian, as well as the potential entry of bananas and mangoes, Laurel is looking to facilitate the entry of Egyptian grapes and ware potatoes in the country.\nThe entry of the two commodities is in the works, with pest risk assessment and food safety analysis currently being finalized.\nLaurel said the government is also exploring the potential of sourcing garlic and onions from Egypt. The technical assistance and information exchange for the said goods are already planned in the near future.\nBased on government data, agricultural trade between the two countries stood at around $7.5 million annually.\nThe Philippines primarily exports desiccated coconut and carrageenan to Egypt, while importing goods such as broths, soups, and dried kidney beans.\nAccording to the DA, private sector players are upbeat about the potential for a deeper trade agreement with Egypt, given its capacity as a gateway to regional markets in Africa and the Middle East.\nThe agency, in particular, is ramping up its efforts to unlock new trade opportunities in fast-growing markets such as North Africa.\nWith Egypt as a potential new market for more Philippine produce, this is seen as an expansion to both countries’ diplomatic relations that started in 1946.\nAside from durian’s entry to the African country, last month also saw the debut of fresh mangoes to Italy.\nThe government is currently in negotiations to bring durian to New Zealand, further expanding the income and market opportunities for durian farmers, especially those in Mindanao.

high-performance-without-burnout	High performance without burnout	High performance is often connected to burnout. However, there are many ways to avoid burnout while striving for high performance. People are increasingly realizing that excelling in their work or any endeavor doesn't have to come at the cost of burnout.\nWhen one is passionate about what they do, high performance often follows naturally. But the problem sometimes arises when we work hard without realizing we haven't taken time to rest. People sometimes don't even recognize burnout taking place in their bodies until they feel extremely tired and lose the enthusiasm to work, or worse, fall into depression.\nStatistics from a 2020 Gallup report indicate that high performance is often linked to burnout, with 76% experiencing it (source: Forbes.com dated 2.12.25). Sometimes we think that because we are passionate and enthusiastic about what we are doing, we will never experience burnout. But as the popular saying goes, "the spirit may be willing but the flesh is weak," and the body has limited capacity. Eventually, the mind and body can no longer cope with the workload and activities.\nThere are high performers who are simply competitive, and their performance is more for the sake of winning, wanting to be better than someone else, or being ahead of “the pack.” They get an adrenaline rush when they compete, but it's not the same kind of enthusiasm that comes from those who are passionate about or love what they do.\nEither way, people who are driven and excel in their work are often unaware that they are on the brink of depression or that their body is exhausted and nearing sickness.\nWe should realize that super achievers are not always those who are constantly stressed or agitated. Relaxed people can also achieve a great deal, sometimes even better than those who are always driven and in a hurry to accomplish something. This is because when one is relaxed, creative thinking flows more freely, and there is better mental clarity.\nBut how can one be a high performer while also avoiding burnout? There are many ways to do this, and one is to learn how to rest not only the body but also the mind. Sometimes people take breaks from work during weekends and vacation leaves, but the minds of chronic workers are still occupied with the tasks they have to complete, the meetings they have to schedule, the revenue they have to generate, etc. I sometimes experience this myself when I am on vacation, and my mind is still thinking about work. However, with practice, you can learn to focus on your rest and relaxation periods and block thoughts about work.\nRest periods, even short ones, are important for your body to recover from stress, agitation, and pressures. In fact, you don't need to wait until your vacation leave or long breaks to recover. Every day, even for just a few minutes, try to take a break, such as a walk outside, a coffee break inside the office while relaxing or reading a non-work-related book, or even sleeping during lunch breaks. Before, I used to go to the gym during lunch break and join the group dance, eat a sandwich after showering, and go back to the office. And I would feel rejuvenated and ready to return to work!\nBreak periods are meant to be recovery time to reset the brain and enhance efficiency because the mind is more relaxed and, thus, more creative. And if you need to rest your body as well, find a place where you can lie down and recuperate or even sleep. When I didn't feel like going to the gym during lunch when I was working in Makati before, I would go to a foot massage salon and sleep.\nBut now that my workplace is near my house, I spend my workouts in the morning, basking in the sunshine, which can improve dopamine (“feel-good neurotransmitter”) levels in the brain and boost happy mood and motivation. Aside from that, I can breathe fresh air while walking in our garden. Breathing can further calm the nervous system and promote relaxation. Nowadays, I practice box breathing, a 4-7-8 technique where you breathe in for 4 seconds, hold it for 7 seconds, and exhale for 8 seconds. This can relax your mind and help you avoid stress.\nAnother way to spend recovery periods is to engage in your favorite hobby, such as reading and meditation. I spend the early hours of the morning reading scriptures and listening to relaxing music while writing in my journal. Try to avoid looking at social media upon waking up since it can trigger a stressful mood.\nThere are many other ways to avoid burnout, such as doing something that matches your talents, skills, and interests, learning to delegate if you are the boss, or asking for help from your co-workers if you are an employee. If needed, try to analyze your own work life and personal life. Research how to best spend recovery periods when you spend so much time at work or in your business.\nAs Richard Carlson wrote in his book DON’T SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF, on the topic of Preventing Burnout, “there is no way to guarantee the prevention of burnout, but there are things you can do to put the odds in your favor.”\n(Wilma Miranda is a Managing Partner of Inventor, Miranda & Associates, CPAs, and a member of the Board of Directors of KPS Outsourcing, Inc. The views expressed herein do not necessarily reflect the opinion of these institutions.)	"\\tImages/high-performance-without-burnout_1.png"	High performance doesn't have to lead to burnout;  rest and relaxation are crucial for avoiding burnout.  Even short breaks can help reset the brain and enhance efficiency.  Relaxed individuals can achieve great things through improved mental clarity and creative thinking.  Prioritize rest periods to maintain high performance while avoiding the detrimental effects of exhaustion.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/05/27/high-performance-without-burnout
visa-eyes-two-more-bank-partnerships-in-philippines-to-bridge-sme-funding-gap	Visa eyes two more bank partnerships in Philippines to bridge SME funding gap	Digital payments giant Visa plans to forge two more partnerships with traditional banks this year—adding to its newly launched collaboration with CIMB Bank Philippines—to help bridge the multi-billion-dollar funding gap for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\n“I’m hoping by the end of the year, we can launch three,” said Jeff Navarro, country manager for Visa Philippines, during a press briefing on Tuesday, May 27, regarding the company’s financing support for SMEs in the country. Navarro refused to disclose which banks Visa was currently negotiating with.\nHe clarified that the recently forged partnership with CIMB Bank Philippines is included in the total partnerships for 2025. The fresh deal with CIMB involved the launch of a new Visa business debit card.\n“Designed to cater to SME owners, the card will be linked to a high-interest business savings account, where business owners can enjoy zero fees, free fund transfers, insurance product offers, as well as a revolving credit facility that they can maximize to grow their business,” Visa stated.\n“Visa has been actively working with local partners to launch innovative products designed to expand financial inclusion for SMEs,” the company said in a statement.\nCompany data showed that SMEs comprise 99 percent, or 1.2 million, of existing businesses in the Philippines. New initiatives and partnerships are designed to expand this sector’s access to credit.\nWhile data also showed that 22 percent of total bank lending in the region goes to SMEs, the Philippines still faces a funding gap for SMEs of $221 billion, roughly 10 percent of the $2.4 trillion funding gap in East Asia and the Pacific.\nThis makes the local funding gap proportionally the second largest in the region, underscoring a significant financial shortfall in the country.\nTo overcome these financial challenges and drive growth, Visa stated that through its $100-million small business accelerator and partnerships with local organizations, the company is supporting SMEs—especially women-led and micro-enterprises.\nGareth Barrington, Visa head of commercial money movement for Southeast Asia, noted that the company has previously partnered with the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA), and The Asia Foundation to support education, scholarships, and grant initiatives.\nIt was clarified that out of the multi-year $100-million investment across the region, no exact amount was specifically pledged for the Philippines.\n“So it really is incumbent upon us, as a country, to articulate the kind of support we need in order to gain access to these funds. But again, the good thing is that it’s a multi-year commitment of $100 million, which will be available for such efforts,” Navarro said.

economic-team-against-200-wage-hike-cite-dangerous-repercussions	Economic team against ₱200 wage hike, cite 'dangerous repercussions'	Raising the minimum wage by ₱200 would have “dangerous repercussions,” including hurting the Philippine economy, small business owners, and driving a spike in consumer price hikes, according to the Marcos administration’s economic managers.\nThis comes as the public has intensified their call for a ₱200 across-the-board minimum wage hike, which is now pending in the House of Representatives, while a ₱100 increase is proposed in the Senate bill.\nAccording to the economic team, passing the bill could hurt the growth of the gross domestic product (GDP), noting that a ₱200 increase might slow growth by 1.6 percentage points, and a ₱100 hike by 0.5 percentage points. As a result, GDP would grow by 4.4 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Both scenarios are predicted to result in the economy missing the lower end of the GDP growth target range,” they said in a joint statement released on Wednesday, June 11. The government is targeting to grow the local economy by six percent to eight percent this year.\nThe economic team is composed of heads of the Department of Finance (DOF), Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), Department of Budget and Management (DBM), and Department of Economy, Planning and Development Authority.\nA ₱200 wage hike could also push inflation up by around two percentage points, while a ₱100 increase may raise it by 0.7 points, they said.\nThey stressed that the “substantial minimum wage increase may lead to higher production costs, which could result in higher prices that may disproportionately affect low-income households.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhile the government has brought the average inflation for the first five months down to 1.9 percent, with headline inflation easing to five-and-a-half-year low in May, an across-the-board minimum wage hike could reverse this progress and trigger a resurgence in high inflation.\nThey added that wage increases that are not matched by productivity gains can add to inflationary pressures.\nAs wage is expected to result in inflated consumer prices, the economic managers said this will “result in the poorest of the poor, who are mostly in the informal sector and do not even make minimum wage, bearing the brunt of the impact of the wage increase.”\nMicro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), which make up over 90 percent of all businesses in the country and largely depend on minimum wage workers, may also struggle to absorb the mandated wage hike—equivalent to ₱4,000 per month for a five-day work week or ₱4,800 for a six-day work week.\n“To cope, some may increase prices of goods and/or services, reduce their workforce, or worse shut down operations altogether, affecting both employees and the broader economy,” they said.\nAs such, businesses “may be forced to either stop hiring or even lay off or retrench workers, resulting in unemployment.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nEmployers may cut jobs, reduce hiring, or shorten workdays to manage higher production costs from the wage hike, potentially raising unemployment by 0.2 to 0.6 percentage points—or 105,000 to 300,000 job losses.\n“Those who will lose their jobs will then shift to the informal sector, which puts them in a worse situation, unable to meet their basic needs and making them more vulnerable, ultimately worsening poverty incidence,” they noted.\nAnother possible outcome, they said, is that some employers may keep their workers but avoid complying with the wage hike by shifting them to the informal sector, leading to weaker labor protections and undermining minimum wage laws.\nUltimately, the economic managers pointed out the irony of the proposed unified wage hikes across all regions. They said this overlooks differences in cost of living, unemployment rates, and business conditions.\nTherefore, the proposed bills could hit less developed regions harder, making it more difficult for them to attract investments and create jobs due to higher labor costs.\nInstead of adopting this proposal, they recommended to the President that “the current system of adjusting wages through the Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Boards (RTWPBs) be maintained.”\nThey added that this should be paired with stronger enforcement of the minimum wage law, ensuring each region can better address workers’ changing needs, and with increased investments to generate more quality jobs.	"\\tImages/economic-team-against-200-wage-hike-cite-dangerous-repercussions_1.png"	The Philippine economic team opposes a ₱200 minimum wage hike, citing potential negative impacts on the economy, including a 1.6 percentage point GDP slowdown and a two-percentage-point inflation increase.  A ₱100 increase would still cause economic harm, slowing GDP growth and raising inflation.  This would disproportionately hurt low-income households and MSMEs, potentially leading to job losses and increased poverty. The team recommends maintaining the current regional wage adjustment system.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/11/economic-team-against-200-wage-hike-cite-dangerous-repercussions
doe-launches-5th-green-energy-auction-focuses-on-fixed-bottom-offshore-wind	DOE launches 5th green energy auction, focuses on fixed-bottom offshore wind	The Department of Energy (DOE) is set to launch the fifth Green Energy Auction (GEA-5), which will specifically offer fixed-bottom offshore wind (OSW) technology.\nIn a statement on Wednesday, June 11, the DOE announced the auction targets an installation capacity of 3,300 megawatts (MW), or approximately 3 gigawatts (GW), with delivery expected to commence between 2028 and 2030.\nThe DOE explained its prioritization of fixed-bottom offshore wind is due to the technology’s established global track record, cost-efficiency, and scalability. This focus is anticipated to streamline OSW developments, particularly those nearing deployment.\nFollowing the GEA-5 launch, developers, port operators, transmission companies, and other stakeholders are invited to join the auction. The terms of reference (TOR) and notice of auction are now available on the DOE website.\nOutgoing Energy Secretary Raphael P.M. Lotilla stressed that initiating GEA-5 will facilitate investment in delivery-ready OSW technology. “This allows us to set a strong and credible foundation for the country’s offshore wind sector, one that can deliver first power by 2028,” he said.\nThis strategic direction comes as the government observes that floating OSW projects in the country remain in early development stages.\n“Globally, only 240 MW of floating wind capacity has been deployed to date, with Hywind Tampen’s 88 MW, which began operations in 2023, currently the largest project,” the DOE stated. It also highlighted that no large-scale commercial floating wind farms have yet been developed.\nThe DOE remains positive, however, citing significant signs of growth in supply chains across Southeast Asia. “Early projects will generate valuable insights, helping to address construction and commissioning challenges and paving the way for more streamlined and efficient deployments in the years ahead,” the department elaborated.\nEnergy Undersecretary Rowena Guevara expressed optimism for floating OSW developments, stating: “As global experience grows and the technology matures, the DOE will reassess its inclusion in future auction rounds. For now, our focus is to build momentum with fixed-bottom projects that can succeed under current technical, regulatory, and infrastructure conditions.”	"\\tImages/doe-launches-5th-green-energy-auction-focuses-on-fixed-bottom-offshore-wind_1.png"	The Department of Energy (DOE) launched the fifth Green Energy Auction (GEA-5), focusing on fixed-bottom offshore wind technology with a 3-gigawatt target.  The DOE prioritizes this technology due to its cost-efficiency and scalability, aiming for power delivery by 2028.  Floating offshore wind projects are in early stages globally, hence the focus on fixed-bottom.

doe-expands-floating-solar-capacity-in-visayas-for-gea-4-bidders	DOE expands floating solar capacity in Visayas for GEA-4 bidders	The Department of Energy (DOE) announced significant enhancements to the fourth round of the Green Energy Auction (GEA-4), including various capacity allocations and rescheduling of timelines to support the development of floating solar technologies in the country.\nIn a statement on Thursday, June 12, the DOE said it has increased the floating solar capacity in Visayas to 175 megawatts (MW), which is scheduled for auction in 2027 and 2028, following the growing demand in the region as well as investor interest.\nThis additional capacity opens up for project development, especially in sites that have limited land area.\nAdditionally, the DOE has reallocated 1,040 megawatts (MW) worth of installation target capacity in Luzon across the years 2027, 2028, and 2029. This supply had previously been scheduled for 2026.\n“This move is designed to provide developers with greater preparation time, improve project feasibility, and support grid readiness for this specialized technology,” the DOE stated.\n“By proactively adjusting timelines and capacity allocations, the DOE is signaling strong institutional support for innovative renewable energy (RE) solutions, while creating space for broader participation among developers and investors,” it added.\nOther improvements to the framework include the standardization of solar capacity units and greater bidding flexibility, allowing developers to submit bids for either stand-alone solar projects or integrated solar with energy storage systems (ESS).\nMoreover, winning bidders are required to submit a detailed project design that reflects the awarded scheme, while solar and ESS projects will need a new system impact study (SIS).\n“These comprehensive updates underscore the DOE’s mission to deliver a transparent, competitive, and future-forward RE auction system. As the Philippines targets a 35-percent RE share by 2030, the rollout of technologies like floating solar will play a transformative role in achieving a cleaner, more resilient energy future for all Filipinos,” the DOE concluded.	"\\tImages/doe-expands-floating-solar-capacity-in-visayas-for-gea-4-bidders_1.png"	The Department of Energy (DOE) increased Visayas' floating solar capacity to 175 MW for the 2027-2028 auction, driven by regional demand and investor interest.  It also reallocated 1,040 MW of Luzon's installation capacity from 2026 to 2027-2029, improving project feasibility.  The DOE aims to support innovative renewable energy solutions and broader participation.

eu-removes-philippines-from-high-risk-money-laundering-list	EU removes Philippines from high-risk money laundering list	Following the Philippines' removal from the global money-laundering watchlist, also known as the grey list, in February 2025, the European Commission has also removed the country from its list of high-risk jurisdictions.\nWhile some developing were added to the list including Algeria, Angola, Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya, Laos, Lebanon, Monaco, Namibia, Nepal and Venezuela, the Philippines, alongside Panama, Uganda, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Jamaica, Gibraltar, Senegal and Barbados were the countries cross out of the list.\nThis decision suggests that the Philippines and other delisted jurisdictions are now excluded from the high-risk category due to weak measures against money laundering and terrorist financing (AML/CFT).\n“These countries have strengthened the effectiveness of their AML/CFT regimes and addressed technical deficiencies to meet the commitments in their action plans on the strategic deficiencies identified by the FATF [Financial Action Task Force],” the Commission said in its latest report.\nAccording to the Commission, the updated list takes into account FATF’s list of jurisdictions under increased monitoring.\n“Alignment with FATF is important for upholding the EU´s [European Union] commitment to promoting and implementing global standards,” the Commission said.\nThe Commission noted that the Philippines and other countries have already established “legal and regulatory frameworks to meet the commitments in their respective action plans on the strategic deficiencies identified by the FATF.”\nAs such, these countries are “no longer subject to the FATF’s monitoring process” but will continue working with regional bodies further to improve their anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing systems.\nFor his part, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Eli M. Remolona Jr. said the central bank is currently identifying emerging risks for the Philippines to “stay out of those dirty money lists.”\nIt can be recalled that the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC), which is chaired by Remolona, had said that the Philippines exit from the grey list “may prompt foreign banks to review and resume their business relationship and transactions with Philippine financial entities.”\nIt noted that the revision of the list is part of a delegated regulation and will take effect after a one-month review period by the European Parliament and Council, unless they raise any objections. This review period can be extended by another month.\nUnder Article 9 of the 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD IV), the Commission is required to regularly update its list of high-risk countries with weak AML/CFT measures.

let-your-light-shine	Let your light shine	BY Carlos Cervantes\nThe year 1990 marked the beginning of my banking career in Mindanao, where I was immediately immersed in the world of microfinance as an account officer for a local Thrift Bank. As a thrift institution, our mandate was to extend credit to Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). However, my focus quickly gravitated towards the micro-enterprises, predominantly the market retailers. These businesses were often managed by resilient women, mothers who skillfully balanced their entrepreneurial endeavors with their husbands' regular employment, their efforts serving as the crucial lifeline for their families' finances.\nEven in those early days, a subtle unease stirred within me. While our lending program, supported by government guarantees and partial subsidies, provided much-needed financial support, it seemed to overlook a critical element: the integration of values and spiritual formation. I believed then, as I do now, that the rigorous demands of loan repayment and the necessity of sound business governance required a deeper ethical and spiritual foundation. Such a grounding, I felt, was essential for fostering sustainable business relationships and ensuring the long-term viability of these micro-enterprises. Without it, the transactional nature of lending, however well-intentioned, risked falling short of truly empowering these individuals.\nADVERTISEMENT\nYears later, in 2004, a new professional chapter began, offering me the invaluable opportunity to collaborate with Angel “Nonoy” De Leon, the esteemed Chairman of Taytay Sa Kauswagan, Inc. (TSKI). This collaboration, which spanned several years, coincided with TSKI's expansion into Boracay, Aklan. My visits to their centers and my careful study of their company policies and procedures left a lasting impression. I observed that TSKI was not merely a financial institution; it was an organization deeply committed to uplifting the poor, with a particular focus on empowering mothers. Their approach deeply resonated with my earlier conviction that for microfinance to be truly transformative, it must go beyond simple financial transactions and embrace a more holistic philosophy.\nThis past week, from May 30 to June 1, 2025, I had the privilege of attending the 32nd APPEND Leadership Conference (ALC) at the Crowne Plaza Hotel Ortigas, Pasig. APPEND Inc., the Alliance of Philippine Partners in Enterprise Development Inc., is a formidable coalition of microfinance institutions across the Philippines, and the conference served as a powerful demonstration of their collective commitment. The conference theme, "Let Your Light Shine," was not just a catchy slogan but a profound guiding principle. It aimed to broaden the participants' knowledge and leadership skills, urging them towards a more humane and Godly service. This emphasis on integrating faith and service within the microfinance sector was precisely the missing piece I had recognized years ago.\nThe opening ceremonies were a vibrant spectacle, a "Parade of Colors" led by the prominent figures in the Philippine microfinance landscape. Institutions like Alalay Sa Kaunlaran, Inc. (ASKI), The Center for Agriculture and Rural Development, Inc.; Mutually Reinforcing Institutions (CARD MRI), Taytay Sa Kauswagan, Inc. (TSKI), and Tulay sa Pag-unlad, Inc. (TSPI) were among the many represented, their collective presence highlighting the strength and unity of the microfinance community. Amidst this distinguished gathering, I once again had the opportunity to connect with Angel De Leon, who continues to serve as the President and CEO of TSKI and, notably, as the founding Chairman of APPEND. His tireless dedication to this organization was palpable, evident in his unwavering commitment to instilling proper attitudes and guiding people towards the values of the Kingdom of God. His vision, to transform lives not just financially but spiritually, was truly inspiring.\nA notable innovation discussed during the conference was AppendPay, APPEND's newly launched digital payment platform. Angel De Leon, in his address, highlighted its potential, and eager to explore its functionalities, I immediately downloaded the application. The registration process was remarkably quick and seamless, a testament to its user-friendly design. However, a minor glitch arose when my seatmate, despite having a phone with an identical operating system version, was unable to find the application in his store – a small issue for the system developers to address. Within 24 hours of my registration, I received notification that my KYC (Know Your Customer) application had been approved, verifying my user status and enabling my AppendPay e-Wallet. This efficiency was commendable. My next step, of course, will be to assess its competitiveness against established players like traditional banks, Gcash, and PayMaya in terms of transaction costs.\nThe conference's overarching theme was thoughtfully divided into three equally significant sub-themes: REJOICE, REKINDLE, and RADIATE. Each sub-theme offered a unique perspective on the multifaceted nature of microfinance and its impact.\nDay 1 began with Senator Paolo Benigno “Bam” A. Aquino IV delivering the keynote address on REJOICE. Senator Aquino's eloquence and clarity were truly inspiring, igniting a sense of hope for more progressive and people-centric senate legislation. His words resonated with the audience, reinforcing the belief that policy can be a powerful instrument for positive change within the microfinance sector.\nDay 2 shifted focus to REKINDLE, with a profound morning session led by Rev. Father Dennis Antonio Y. Paez SDB. Father Paez guided the participants through a reflective exercise, prompting us to articulate our gratitude for being part of the microfinance organizations we currently serve. For me, as a Board Trustee of Tulay sa Pag-unlad Inc., my gratitude stemmed from the organization's unwavering dedication to empowering mothers and nurturing them into responsible stewards of their businesses. Father Paez underscored a crucial truth: in serving the poor, the essence lies not in what one does or gives, but in how one makes them feel. This poignant reminder emphasized the importance of empathy and genuine connection in the pursuit of social good.\nThe conference culminated on Day 3 with His Excellency Most Reverend Bishop Broderick S. Pabillo, the Vicar Apostolic of Taytay, Palawan, delivering an inspiring address on RADIATE. Bishop Pabillo powerfully articulated the concept of evangelization through microfinance, moving beyond the mere provision of financial assistance to encompass the holistic care of an individual's spiritual needs. His emphasis on the interconnectedness of worldly and spiritual well-being underscored the transformative potential of microfinance when approached with a comprehensive vision. He reiterated the profound principle that to save one is to save all, highlighting the ripple effect of individual empowerment on the broader community.\nAccording to the Master of Ceremonies, the affair was by far the best and most well-organized leadership conference of APPEND in the last 32 years, and she thanked TSPI as the host organization, led by its chairman, Atty. Lamberto Meer, for a well-prepared program. The members of APPEND resolved to work more closely together and be united in achieving the conference’s theme.\nFor those interested in delving deeper into the vital work of APPEND and the broader microfinance movement, the recent APPEND conference actively shared its insights and discussions through the following hashtags: #32APPENDALC, #32ndALCTSPI, and #append. These platforms offer a valuable avenue for continued engagement and a deeper understanding of the ongoing efforts to illuminate lives and foster sustainable development through microfinance. The conference served as a powerful reminder that microfinance, at its heart, is about more than just numbers; it's about empowering individuals, fostering community, and ultimately, letting their light shine.

crypto-e-gaming-risks-remain-despite-philippines-exit-from-eu-high-risk-list-moodys	Crypto, e-gaming risks remain despite Philippines' exit from EU high-risk list—Moody's	While the Philippines’ exit from the European Union’s (EU) high-risk jurisdictions list is expected to ease the country’s access to the EU financial system, debt watcher Moody’s still urged continued vigilance in sectors such as online gaming and cryptocurrency to ensure it does not return to any dirty money lists.\nMoody’s associate director Xiao Chen said in a June 13 commentary that the Philippines’ removal from the list is “expected to improve the country’s financial reputation, ease access to the EU financial system, and support cross-border trade and investment.”\nChen also noted that this development “signals the Philippines’ alignment with global regulatory standards.”\nHowever, Chen stressed the importance of continued vigilance, “particularly in sectors such as online gaming and cryptocurrency, to ensure that residual risks are effectively managed.”\nLast week, the EU crossed out from its high-risk list the Philippines, Panama, Uganda, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Jamaica, Gibraltar, Senegal, and Barbados. Meanwhile, added to the list were Algeria, Angola, Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya, Laos, Lebanon, Monaco, Namibia, Nepal, and Venezuela.\nThe EU’s decision to delist the Philippines and other delisted jurisdictions means these countries are now excluded from the high-risk category due to strengthened anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CFT) measures.\nChen said this marks “another important milestone” for the Philippines “in its ongoing efforts to strengthen financial integrity.”\nThe European Commission said the Philippines and other countries taken off the list have improved their AML/CFT systems and fixed technical issues to meet the action plan commitments set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).\nIt added that the updated list has taken into account FATF’s list of jurisdictions under increased monitoring, also known as the “grey list.” Alignment with FATF is “important for upholding the EU´s commitment to promoting and implementing global standards,” it further said.\nAccording to the Commission, the Philippines has already put in place legal and regulatory measures to address the issues flagged by FATF. As such, it is no longer under FATF monitoring but will keep working with regional groups to strengthen their AML/CFT efforts.\nBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Eli M. Remolona Jr. said earlier that the central bank is currently identifying emerging risks for the Philippines to “stay out of those dirty money lists.”\nIt can be recalled that the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC), which is chaired by Remolona, had said that the Philippines exit from the grey list “may prompt foreign banks to review and resume their business relationship and transactions with Philippine financial entities.”\nAccording to AMLC, even before the grey-listing, the Philippines was considered to have “weak anti-dirty money regimes.” This came with strict requirements and fines imposed by foreign regulators on financial institutions or banks doing business with Philippine entities.\nAs a result, several banks avoided doing business with local entities “rather than managing possible money laundering or terrorist financing risks.”\nThe country’s inclusion in FATF’s grey list was “burdensome” for banks and other financial institutions as it strained correspondent banking ties and slowed international financial inflows into the country.\nThe Philippines was removed from the grey list in February 2025.	"\\tImages/crypto-e-gaming-risks-remain-after-philippines-exit-from-eu-high-risk-listmoodys_1.png"	The Philippines' removal from the EU's high-risk list improves its financial reputation and access to the EU system.  However, Moody's urges continued vigilance in online gaming and cryptocurrency sectors to mitigate risks.  The EU's decision reflects the Philippines' improved anti-money laundering measures.  The country's central bank is identifying emerging risks to maintain its clean financial standing.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/13/crypto-e-gaming-risks-remain-after-philippines-exit-from-eu-high-risk-listmoodys
map-calls-for-increased-budget-allocation-for-nutrition-sensitive-programs	MAP calls for increased budget allocation for nutrition-sensitive programs	The country’s leading business executives are urging the government to allocate more funds for nutrition-sensitive programs in the country’s national budget, following the recent enactment of a law improving the quality of early childhood education and care in the country.\nThe Management Association of the Philippines (MAP), which comprises the country’s tycoons and business leaders, said it fully supports Republic Act (RA) No. 12199, or the Early Childhood Care and Development (ECCD) System Act.\nThe ECCD Act, signed on May 8, is anchored on strategic mechanisms that aim to provide proper education, care, and nutrition for children under five years old.\nMAP, in particular, lauded the law for educating and training parents and parent substitutes on responsible caregiving.\nIt likewise commended its move to urge active involvement of parents and communities in ECCD programs, as well as its measure to raise awareness about efforts to improve the quality of life for young children and families.\nMAP said this law should enable future deliberations of the country’s national budget to prioritize funding for programs that will address “underlying determinants of proper nutrition.”\nThe business group said more funding should be directed to services that push for food security, access to nutritious food at cheaper prices, and availability of health and social services.\nIt also vouched for nutrition-specific interventions that deal with micronutrient deficiency and other immediate causes of maternal and child malnutrition.\nIn February of this year, MAP joined other business organizations such as the Makati Business Club (MBC) in calling for a more “transparent and accountable” budget process.\nIn a strongly-worded statement, the groups raised the alarm on changes introduced by the bicameral conference committee in the 2025 General Appropriations Act (GAA), which embodies this year’s budget of ₱6.326 trillion.\nThey pointed out that the committee, composed of members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, significantly reduced allocations for programmed healthcare, social services, and education projects.\n“In place of these programmed projects, the bicameral committee inserted local infrastructure projects and types of unconditional cash transfers which, we believe, promote a culture of patronage and dependency,” the groups said.\nMeanwhile, MAP said it welcomes the opportunity to participate in the crafting of the ECCD Act’s implementing rules and regulations (IRR).\nThe group pointed out that severe malnutrition continues to be a serious problem in the country.\nCiting a World Bank study, it noted that one in every three Filipino children below five years old are suffering from stunting.\nMAP said that through the ECCD Act and other nutrition-sensitive programs, the country will be able to solve its long-running issue with child stunting.\n“Failure to address this national problem in an urgent and decisive manner will place our country's future in the hands of stunted children becoming adults whose capacity to be productive, competitive, and creative is limited,” the group said.\n“That will imperil national development and progress,” it stressed.

dof-orders-immediate-vat-exemption-for-cancer-diabetes-hypertension-meds	DOF orders immediate VAT exemption for cancer, diabetes, hypertension meds	Department of Finance (DOF) Secretary Ralph G. Recto has ordered the swift implementation of the value-added tax (VAT) exemption on the expanded list of medicines for cancer, diabetes, and hypertension.\nRecto, President Marcos’ chief economic manager, has addressed this mandate to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). Aside from the mentioned illnesses, dialysis, high cholesterol, and mental illnesses will also be VAT-free as soon as the law takes effect.\nOn June 4, the BIR released the updated list of medicines exempt from the 12-percent VAT, following the expanded list issued by the Food and Drug Authority (FDA).\nSpecifically, among the newly VAT-exempt cancer medicines is the combination drug Tegafur with Gimeracil and Oteracil Potassium.\nFor diabetic individuals, Metformin Hydrochloride combined with Teneligliptin is also now exempt from VAT.\nPatients with high cholesterol can now get Atorvastatin combined with Fenofibrate VAT-free, while those with high blood pressure can access Metoprolol Tartrate plus Ivabradine without VAT.\nLamotrigine, used to treat mental illnesses, is also exempt from tax.\nThe Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion Act (R.A. 10963) and the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises Act (R.A. 11534) paved the way for expanding the list of VAT-exempt medicines.\nAccording to the DOF, the expansion of the list of VAT-free medicines “significantly reduces out-of-pocket costs for Filipino patients.”\n“This is a huge relief for Filipinos, especially for the underprivileged who cannot afford expensive medicines. We’re not just helping ease their expenses—we’re also giving them hope to recover and complete their treatment,” Recto said, further ensuring affordable healthcare in the country.

maharlika-head-consing-submits-courtesy-resignation-to-marcos	Maharlika head Consing submits courtesy resignation to Marcos	Maharlika Investment Corp. (MIC) President and CEO Rafael Jose Consing Jr. has submitted his courtesy resignation, along with the firm’s board of directors, which comes amid the newly formed firm’s planned investment rollout.\n“I have submitted my unqualified courtesy resignation,” told Manila Bulletin on Wednesday, May 29, noting that the investment firm’s board of directors has also tendered their resignations.\nThis came after President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ordered all executives of all government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs) to step down from their posts so the President could “assess the performance of key government agencies, including GOCCs, and realign government priorities.”\nAccording to the Palace, this move is also “in response to the evolving expectations of the Filipino people.” This was also among the reasons cited by the President when he told his Cabinet secretaries to file courtesy exits.\nConsing said his team views the President’s decision as an “important and standard measure to uphold accountability and further strengthen public service.”\nNo delays\nDepartment of Budget and Management (DBM) Secretary Amenah F. Pangandaman told Manila Bulletin on Thursday, May 29, that she “does not foresee any delays in national programs or transactions involving GOCCs” even with the blanket directive.\n“The President’s call is a routine governance measure and does not disrupt budget planning or fiscal operations. It’s business as usual,” Pangandaman said.\n“Until a resignation is formally accepted, heads of GOCCs must carry out their duties. Their agencies are expected to continue normal and stable operations, and provide the public with uninterrupted service delivery,” Pangandmana further explained.\nAs of writing, the GCG has yet to update the public on the total number of GOCC executives who have stepped down from their positions.\n“The courtesy resignations are being filed electronically and physically. We have not determined the exact number yet as it is a continuing process,” GCG chairperson Marius P. Corpus told Manila Bulletin.\n“We only issued the notice to GOCCs the other day. So, we expect more letters are forthcoming. Nonetheless, I will instruct the Division concerned in our Office to come up with the numbers,” Corpus said.\nManila Bulletin asked President Marcos’ chief economic manager Ralph G. Recto last Wednesday, May 28, regarding the potential effect of the GCG order on state-run corporations’ operations and income generation through the dividends they remit to the national government, but he did not reply. Recto, as Department of Finance (DOF) chief, oversees GOCCs.\nMoving forward, Consing said all the MIC executives will “continue to diligently perform our respective duties and responsibilities until advised otherwise.” Consing only has only about one-and-a-half years before his three-year appointment ends in November 2026.\nMaharlika investments\nConsing told Manila Bulletin early this month that MIC, which manages the Philippines’ first sovereign wealth fund, is eyeing at least three new investments before the year ends, aiming to bring total capital commitments to as much as ₱37 billion just two years into its establishment.\nFrom the current ₱28-29 billion in investments, additional commitments worth an estimated total of under ₱10 billion are in the pipeline across three or more upcoming projects.\nTo date, the one-and-a-half-year-old Maharlika Investment Fund (MIF) has undertaken a ₱19.7-billion investment in the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP), where it now holds a 20-percent stake; MIC's strategic partnership with Thailand’s Charoen Pokphand Group Co. Ltd. for investments in agriculture and food production, digital innovation, as well as sustainable energy; and a $76.4-million bridge loan to Makilala Mining Co. Inc. to develop the Maalinao-Caigutan-Biyog copper-gold project in Kalinga province.\nConsing had noted that the NGCP stake is the company’s first and largest investment so far, and future deals will involve smaller amounts. He added that the ₱35 to ₱37 billion in planned investments by year-end will also cover a transportation and logistics infrastructure project.\nHe further said that there have been agreements to begin investment talks with a public listed company, which he had refused to name. He only described it as “partly listed” on the local stock exchange.\nHe had said MIC expects to start seeing returns from its current and upcoming investments within two to three years.\nMIC’s immediate contribution to the Philippine economy, he said, will come from capital deployment, noting that the company is already making investments.\nMIC currently has a lean team of 35 staff, Consing said. The investment team has 11 members, including himself, with plans to expand to 15. A similar target is set for the legal and transaction team, which now has nine members. So far, only Consing holds a plantilla position, while the rest are on contracts of service.\nConsing had earlier said he is optimistic that the Governance Commission for GOCCs (GCG) will soon approve MIC’s pending plantilla positions.\nBecause the sovereign wealth fund uses taxpayers' money, all approved and upcoming investments go through a “very stringent” approval process, the MIC chief said. The investment committee, chaired by Finance Secretary Ralph G. Recto and vice-chaired by Consing, reviews and recommends proposals to the MIC board.\nMIC’s investment decisions take six to eight months, much longer than the private sector where similar decisions are made in about half that time, Consing had noted.

This is to assess performance and realign government priorities, a move the Palace says responds to evolving public expectations.

government-borrowings-dip-in-jan-april-2025-driven-by-lower-local-loans	Government borrowings dip in Jan-April 2025, driven by lower local loans	The national government lowered its borrowings to ₱1.14 trillion from January to April 2025, down by ₱28 billion from last year’s ₱1.16 trillion, mainly due to the massive decline in borrowings from local lenders.\nAccording to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr), the January-to-April figure was 2.4 percent lower than the government’s gross revenue recorded in the same period last year.\nAs of end-April, gross borrowings accounted for 44.7 percent of the government’s total planned borrowings of ₱2.55 trillion for the year.\nADVERTISEMENT\nGross domestic debt stood at ₱835.5 billion, significantly dropping by 19.6 percent from the government’s gross domestic loans in the previous year at ₱1.04 trillion\nIt accounted for 73.3 percent of the total borrowings, falling short of the government’s 80 percent target share of the total borrowings. This year, the government plans to acquire 20 percent of its financing from foreign sources and 80 percent from domestic sources, resulting in an 80:20 borrowing mix.\nBroken down, the government reduced its borrowings from short-dated treasury bills (T-bills), which stood at ₱66.1 billion, from ₱76.8 billion a year ago.\nMeanwhile, the BTr raised P469.4 billion from fixed-rate treasury bonds (T-bonds), 24.4 percent higher than the P377.3 billion it borrowed in the first four months of 2024.\nNotably, the government had issued retail treasury bonds (RTBs) worth P584.9 billion in 2024, which was issued this year. But the government borrowed through fixed-rate treasury notes, raising P300 billion during the period. There was no sale of this a year ago.\nMeanwhile, the government borrowed nearly triple the amount in foreign loans during the period to P299.7 billion from P124.1 billion a year earlier.\nForeign loans accounted for 26.3 percent of the total, still exceeding the 20-percent target share of foreign debt.\nNotably, global bonds totaling ₱192 billion were settled during the fourth-month period, a massive jump from zero in the same period of the previous year.\nMeanwhile, it had trimmed down its program loans from P95.4 billion a year ago to P85.2 billion in the first quarter.\nIt likewise reduced the value of its project loans to P22.5 billion from P28.7 billion a year earlier.\nIt can be recalled that the Marcos administration’s gross borrowings surged to ₱2.56 trillion in 2024, a 16.9 percent increase from ₱2.19 trillion in the previous year, driven by a sharp rise in both domestic and foreign debt.\nLast year’s total borrowings exceeded the administration’s borrowing plan by ₱100 billion. It was 4.07 percent higher than the programmed ₱2.46 trillion for the year.

doe-biodiesel-blend-increase-on-hold-due-to-coconut-oil-costs-supply	DOE: Biodiesel blend increase on hold due to coconut oil costs, supply	The Department of Energy (DOE) said that the resumption of the biodiesel blend increase will be under evaluation by the National Biofuels Board (NBB), following the suspension of the blend over tight supply and higher costs of coconut oil.\nIn a briefing on Friday, June 13, Energy Undersecretary Alessandro Sales explained that there would be a periodic review of the biofuel increases to determine their feasibility.\nAccording to Sales, the resumption of implementation will be “studied by the board on a regular basis because there are a lot of factors involved, not just the price of the feedstock, it's also the availability of the feedstock.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nHe also noted that the feedstock has gained quite some competition, noting that “there are so many competitive friction and of course, in rolling out higher blends as we did experience when we rolled out to B3 there is also the adjustment to the logistics by both the manufacturers of coco methyl ester (CME) and the end-users which are the oil companies.”\nRecently, the NBB sought to suspend the increase of the four percent (B4) biodiesel blend that was initially scheduled in October 2025, and the five percent blend (B5) by October 2026.\n“This was decided because of the prevailing high cost of coconut oil, which is the principal feedstock for our coco methyl ester, the biodiesel component in the diesel being sold in the Philippines,” Sales explained.\nHe emphasized that pushing the B4 mandate given the current circumstances would add to the price pressure, but clarified that this would not mean a complete ban on the blend.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOutgoing Energy Secretary Raphael P.M. Lotilla added that despite the higher demand for coconut feedstock, local farmers are benefiting from higher coconut oil prices.\n“In the meantime, we do recognize that the government has a big program to plant more coconuts and there will be additional volumes available in five to seven years,” he said.\n“Therefore, we will have to make sure that our production meets the demand and that we both externally and internally… The bottom line is our [coconut farmers] are happy with the prices that they are getting right now for the price of coconut oil,” he added.\nMeanwhile, Chemrez Technologies, Inc. further supported this action, stating that adverse effects of the weather have affected their production.\n“Coconut is our feedstock for Biodiesel, and the El Niño of 2024 adversely affected supplies in 2025. The NBB and PCA have evaluated the supply situation and have given a sensible recommendation to postpone B4,” he said.\nChemrez, along with other members of the coconut industry, are awaiting a definite date to resume the B4 mandate, stating that it will take five months in advance to prepare for the implementation.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“The progression towards B5 remains a sound and sustainable solution for the Philippines to attain its economic, environmental, and health goals,” he added.\nAs per the Biofuels Act of 2006, all diesel fuel must incorporate a certain amount of CME to promote cleaner-burning fuels as well as support the local coconut industry.

The National Biofuels Board (NBB) will periodically review the feasibility of resuming the increase.  Higher coconut oil prices benefit local farmers, but the B4 mandate's postponement prevents added price pressure.  Chemrez Technologies supports the delay due to El Niño's impact on coconut supplies; a five-month preparation period is needed before resuming the B4 mandate.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/13/doe-biodiesel-blend-increase-on-hold-due-to-coconut-oil-costs-supply
moodys-affirms-credit-ratings-of-bdo-bpi-and-metrobank-despite-rising-asset-risks-funding-pressures	Moody's affirms credit ratings of BDO, BPI, and Metrobank despite rising asset risks, funding pressures	Moody’s Ratings has affirmed the credit ratings of three of the Philippines’ largest banks—BDO Unibank Inc., Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI), and Metropolitan Bank & Trust Co. (Metrobank)—on the back of their solid capital positions, stable profitability, and strong liquidity, even as they face challenges from rising consumer loan exposure and shifts in funding structures.\nBDO\nMoody’s, a global credit rating agency, kept its Baa2/P-2 ratings for BDO Unibank unchanged, including the bank’s senior unsecured debt and medium-term note program. Ratings for BDO’s foreign currency debt, such as long-term bonds and short-term borrowings, were also maintained.\nAccording to the credit rater, its BDO affirmation “reflects the bank’s stable asset quality and strong credit underwriting despite its high consumer loan growth over the past [three] years. At the same time, the affirmation reflects the bank’s robust funding and liquidity, good profitability and adequate capital.”\nBDO’s asset quality stayed stable despite rapid consumer loan growth from 2022 to 2024, with its problem loan ratio steady at 1.9 percent by end-2024. Strong underwriting and a solid depositor base help manage risks, while its 148 percent loan coverage remains among the highest locally.\n“We expect its problem loan ratio to remain stable in 2025, with unseasoned loan risks partially mitigated by the bank's track record of strong underwriting and its focus on consumer loan origination from its current depositor base.”\nIts problem loan coverage ratio stood at 148 percent as of end-2024, “one of the strongest among its domestic rated-peers,” reflecting strong loss-absorption capacity.\nBDO’s return on assets rose to 1.8 percent in 2024 from 1.7 percent, supported by steady margins, higher non-interest income, and lower credit costs. Moody’s expects the bank’s profitability to stay stable this year, with loan growth and non-interest income helping offset margin pressures.\nIts capital ratio held steady at 14.6 percent in 2024, up from 14.4 percent in 2023 and significantly higher than 13.7 percent in 2019. The ratio is expected to remain around 14 to 15 percent in 2025, supported by strong internal capital generation.\n“Meanwhile, we expect the bank’s funding and liquidity to remain its key strengths, with a robust and growing dominant franchise supporting its deposit market share, which was the highest among its domestic rated-peers as of end-2024,” Moody’s said.\nBDO maintains strong liquidity with a 132-percent coverage ratio as of end-2024, while keeping low reliance on market funding at just six percent of tangible banking assets.\nBPI\nMoody’s has also affirmed BPI’s ratings, including its deposit, counterparty risk, and senior unsecured debt ratings, along with its baa2 baseline credit assessment (BCA). Its outlook on all applicable ratings remains stable.\nAccording to the credit rater, the affirmation “reflects the bank’s adequate capital, healthy liquidity, and good profitability.”\n“These credit strengths are balanced against BPI’s deteriorating asset quality, driven by its rapid loan growth into the higher risk consumer segments,” Moody’s noted.\nBPI’s problem loan ratio stayed stable at 3.1 percent by end-2024, but its soured loan ratio rose to 2.3 percent by March, due to higher delinquencies in unsecured loans like credit cards and personal loans. Loan coverage also dropped to 77 percent from 99 percent due to increased retail loan write-offs.\n“We expect further weakening in the bank’s asset quality as its loans season, and as a consequence of its target to double-digit growth in higher risk segments such as its credit cards, personal and business bank (small and medium-sized enterprises) loans,” Moody’s said.\nThis shift could move BPI toward slightly riskier credit levels as it works to expand financial access, it said.\nBPI’s return on assets (ROA) rose to 1.9 percent in 2024, supported by higher margins and low credit costs, and remained stable at around two percent in early 2025. However, it is expected to ease this year due to rising credit costs tied to growth in unsecured retail loans.\nIts capital ratios declined last year due to strong loan growth, with its common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio falling to 13.9 percent before recovering to 14.7 percent by March. Moody’s expects the ratio to stay around 13.5 to 14 percent, supported by solid earnings and moderate dividend payouts.\nBPI’s funding and liquidity remain strong, with market fund reliance low at five percent and liquid assets making up 27 percent of tangible banking assets as of 2024.\n“We expect the bank’s funding and liquidity metrics to remain strong despite some deterioration as the bank accelerates growth,” Moody’s said.\nMetrobank\nMoody’s said the affirmation of Metrobank’s Baa2 ratings and baa2 BCA “reflects the bank’s strong solvency, balanced against weakened funding and liquidity metrics.”\n“While we assume Metrobank will receive support from the [government] in times of need, the bank ratings do not benefit from government support uplift because its BCA is already at the same level as the sovereign rating,” which is Baa2 stable, it said.\nMetrobank’s strong solvency is backed by solid asset quality and steady profitability. Its bad loan ratio stayed stable in March, despite higher retail loan delinquencies, with non-retail loans expected to support overall asset quality. The bank also has a strong loan loss reserve, covering 151 percent of problem loans.\nThe bank’s annualized ROA remained steady at 1.4 percent in the first quarter of the year, compared to 1.5 percent a year ago. Moody’s expects the bank’s profitability to dip slightly over the next 12 to 18 months but should stay above one percent.\nIts capitalization has declined in recent years, with its CET1 ratio falling to 14.7 percent in March from 16 percent a year earlier. Moody’s expects this ratio to remain stable, viewing 15 percent as enough to support the bank’s loan growth.\nMetrobank’s funding structure weakened over the past 12 to 18 months, with market funds rising to 21 percent of tangible banking assets in March, up from 10 percent last year, as the bank relied more on cheaper funding to fuel growth.\n“We expect the reliance on market funds to remain broadly stable at the current level. While loan growth will moderate in 2025, we expect the bank to maintain its net interest margin by funding its growth with cheaper sources of funds,” Moody’s said.\nThe bank maintained a strong liquidity buffer with a coverage ratio of 184 percent as of March 2025—down from 276 percent a year earlier, but still above that of some rated peers in the Philippines.	"\\tImages/moodys-affirms-credit-ratings-of-bdo-bpi-and-metrobank-despite-rising-asset-risks-funding-pressures_1.png"	Moody's affirmed the credit ratings of BDO, BPI, and Metrobank due to their strong capital positions, profitability, and liquidity.  Despite rising asset risks and funding pressures, BDO showed stable asset quality and strong underwriting. BPI's asset quality is deteriorating due to growth in higher-risk consumer segments, while Metrobank's funding and liquidity metrics weakened.  All three banks maintain generally positive credit ratings.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/05/27/moodys-affirms-credit-ratings-of-bdo-bpi-and-metrobank-despite-rising-asset-risks-funding-pressures
govt-to-include-minimum-wage-earners-in-20-kilo-rice-program	Gov't to include minimum wage earners in ₱20/kilo rice program	The Department of Agriculture (DA) is set to include minimum wage earners in the government’s ongoing ₱20-per-kilo rice program beginning next month, further expanding access to cheaper rice.\nIn a statement, the DA said it has “agreed in principle” with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) to include minimum wage workers as present beneficiaries of the program.\nCurrently, the ₱20 rice is only available for underprivileged sectors—senior citizens, persons with disabilities (PWDs), solo parents, and members of the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino program (4Ps).\nOn Tuesday, May 27, Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma met with Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel to discuss the proposal of including minimum wage earners in the subsidized rice program.\n“We had a very good and fruitful discussion in our shared goal of helping our workers, particularly minimum wage earners. By including them in this rice program, we aim to improve their purchasing power,” said Laguesma.\nLaurel, meanwhile, said the move to incorporate employees earning the minimum wage in the ₱20 rice initiative is aligned with the government’s efforts to scale and sustain the program through 2028.\n“This initiative stems from the President’s promise to extend the ₱20 rice program to those who need it most,” he said.\nBased on the agreement with the DOLE, Laurel said the workers who will benefit from the program is set to be limited to companies that have expressed interest.\nHe said eligible workers from participating companies will start having access to the cheap rice in June.\nEarlier, the DA stated that it plans to expand the program to include low- to lower-middle-income families in the near future.\nThis is set to be preceded by the scheduled expansion into regions in Luzon and Mindanao, following the initial launch in Visayas.\nThe DA is planning to sustain the ₱20 rice until 2028, potentially covering up to 15 million households, or approximately 60 million Filipinos.

government-to-broker-pork-prices-as-msrp-is-set-to-return	Government to broker pork prices as MSRP is set to return	The Department of Agriculture (DA) is charting the return of the maximum suggested retail price (MSRP) on pork in Metro Manila’s wet markets in the third quarter of the year, which will now see the government play a more substantial role as a middleman to curb rising pork prices.\nThe MSRP, which was enforced as a measure to lower retail prices of pork, was earlier suspended by the DA over low compliance.\nBased on the agency’s monitoring, compliance with the price cap was below five percent as of May 2, a steep decline from the already low 30 percent compliance on April 1.\nAgriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel said he is looking into reimplementing the MSRP on pork between July and August.\nThe MSRP, initially set in March, will remain unchanged.\nThe price limit of pork was set at ₱350 per kilo for pigue (leg/ham) and kasim (shoulder), ₱380 per kilo for liempo (pork belly), and ₱300 per kilo for “sabit ulo” or freshly slaughtered carcass at ₱300 per kilo.\nLaurel said there is no definitive date yet on its return as the agency is still “fixing” internal rules, particularly on the side of the National Meat Inspection Service (NMIS).\nTo prevent low compliance in its return, the DA is reverting to the classic hallmark of market economics: competition.\nThe DA, through the state-run Food Terminal Inc. (FTI), has been procuring 100 live hogs daily from Thailand-based Charoen Pokphand Foods PLC (CP Foods), which will then be processed to be delivered to various retailers.\nIt was recently disclosed that the government will raise the daily delivery to 500 hogs before the year-end.\nSo far, Laurel said the FTI has already been procuring from local farms for over a month to bolster the delivery, as negotiations with other suppliers are also underway.\nLaurel explained that the FTI, through its own budget, will now ramp up efforts to purchase more hogs from suppliers.\nIn particular, the government is targeting to procure approximately 150,000 tons of pork before the end of the year.\nHe, however, noted that attached agency may request as much as ₱500 million from Malacañang as “standby money” in case it is needed.\nUnder this scheme, the FTI will provide directly to retailers, providing them with a margin of ₱30 to ₱50 to ensure that their earnings remain robust.\n“The middleman won't totally disappear, but the President's order is to reduce the middleman, make a way for the pork to be cheaper,” Laurel said in an interview.\nThe secretary said the retailers which will be sourcing its supply from the FTI would likely have lower retail prices, which could impel other retailers to bring their prices down to attract customers.\n“If we compete with other retailers, so dapat bumaba ang presyo (then prices should go down). We're creating competition,” he emphasized.\nIn a related development, Laurel said the testing of the vaccine against the African swine fever (ASF) is now on its genome sequencing phase, one step closer to its commercial rollout.\nWhile the results of this study will be released this week, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will be tapping a third-party group of academics and experts to further evaluate the vaccine.\nLaurel said this is part of the repopulation measure of the government to restore the country’s hog population before the emergence of the ASF in 2019.\nPre-ASF, hog population stood at around 13 million. Now, it has fell to approximately 8.5 million.	"\\tImages/government-to-broker-pork-prices-as-msrp-is-set-to-return_1.png"	The Philippine government plans to reimplement the maximum suggested retail price (MSRP) on pork in Metro Manila's wet markets to control rising prices.  Low compliance led to the MSRP's initial suspension, but the government will now act as a middleman, procuring pork from various suppliers. The Food Terminal Inc. (FTI) will directly supply retailers, fostering competition and potentially lowering prices.  This strategy aims to reduce the impact of middlemen and make pork more affordable.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/05/29/government-to-broker-pork-prices-as-msrp-is-set-to-return
macroeconomic-benefit-with-financial-risk	Macroeconomic benefit with financial risk	The buzz and market excitement in the marketplace is being kept up by the price of rice at ₱20 per kilo, which vulnerable sectors in particular areas can avail of right from the start.\nIt’s no longer just a campaign promise but is now being enforced, with the President brushing aside criticisms, which described the program as just a “public relations” drive to improve the administration’s image. Its viability and sustainability, and the initiative itself, are now being put to the test.\nCertainly, the optics are positive – a welcome and cost-saving development for senior citizens, solo parents, PWDs, and 4Ps beneficiaries. Authorities are even exploring the possibility of extending this initiative to low and lower-middle-income families.\nLooking at the bigger picture, this initiative presents both a macroeconomic benefit and a financial risk. Yes, Virginia, a key macroeconomic benefit of this program is its potential to significantly influence the inflation path.\nConsidering the domestic environment, and setting aside offshore geopolitical issues, should the program prove sustainable as the President has indicated, inflation could be benign in the coming months, given that rice is a major component of the basket of goods.\nIn the overall inflation calculation, the specific recipients of the lower-priced rice are not a factor. Therefore, a lower price of rice has a significant impact on inflation trends.\nConsequently, lower inflation could allow the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) to further reduce its key policy interest rates, even as the US Federal Reserve opts to hold rates steady amid growing concerns about slowing economic growth.\nHowever, on the other side, implementing this program will mean increased government expenditure. It's a form of subsidy, and what my lion’s ear heard was that it was not included in the current year's budgetary allocation.\nThis poses a risk – higher unprogrammed spending that could push the national government’s budget deficit beyond its target of ₱1.5 trillion for the year, which is approximately 5.3 percent of the gross domestic product.\nBased on the latest fiscal balance, the national government's spending exceeded its earnings in the first quarter of the year, with public spending at ₱1.477 trillion against revenues of ₱998.2 billion.\nConversely, should the BSP continue to adopt quantitative monetary easing, this would mean lower borrowing costs for the national government.\nA careful balancing act is necessary here, particularly in light of the International Monetary Fund's recent Article IV review of the Philippines, which emphasized the government's need to adhere to its medium-term fiscal consolidation path.\nIt remains unclear whether this supplemental budget or subsidy for the National Food Authority (NFA), which is in charge of this initiative, is included in the approved 2025 budgetary allocation.\nThe NFA is one of the 14 closely monitored government-owned and controlled corporations. Additional subsidies to the NFA will also increase the Consolidated Public Sector Deficit and could seriously impact the government's fiscal consolidation efforts.\nAs IMF Mission Chief Elif Arbati Saxegaard stated, “The medium-term fiscal consolidation remains appropriate and should be supported by a sustainable plan to raise tax revenues and implement expenditure reforms to ensure that deficit targets are met and to create more space for priority spending.”\nWe instinctively tend to view deficits as negative and surpluses as positive. In this context, palay and rice subsidies could be considered priority spending due to their inclusive effect on marginalized sectors, but they could also increase the deficit.\nTherefore, an additional revenue stream is necessary to avoid a negative impact on the budget deficit target.\nLooking ahead, a comprehensive approach – a fundamental program addressing both productivity and the welfare of farmers – is essential to achieve food security.\nTalkback to me at sionil731@gmail.com	"\\tImages/macroeconomic-benefit-with-financial-risk_1.png"	The program provides low-priced rice, benefiting vulnerable sectors and potentially influencing inflation.  Lower inflation might allow the BSP to reduce interest rates. However, increased government expenditure poses a financial risk, potentially exceeding the budget deficit target.  A careful balancing act is needed to avoid negatively impacting fiscal consolidation efforts.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/05/30/macroeconomic-benefit-with-financial-risk
gsis-offers-new-loan-restructuring-for-govt-employees	GSIS offers new loan restructuring for gov't employees	State-run Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) is offering government workers a chance to escape high-interest loans through its enhanced Ginhawa Max Loan Buyout program, which directly addresses the financial struggles many public servants face.\nIn a statement, Wick Veloso, GSIS president and general manager, said the Ginhawa Max Loan Buyout allows qualified government employees to consolidate and settle their existing high-interest loans from other lenders.\n Through GSIS, borrowers can access interest rates as low as six percent annually. Members have the opportunity to borrow up to ₱5 million or 19 times their monthly salary, whichever is lower, with repayment terms extending up to 10 years and no service fees applied. \nVeloso said this program aims to provide a pathway to financial stability for government workers burdened by predatory lending practices.\n"We want to help public servants break free from the bondage of indebtedness and take confident steps toward financial security,” Veloso said.\n"Our priority is to extend timely financial support and affordable repayment options to more government workers,” he added.\nTo streamline the application process, GSIS now requires only a Letter of Intent (LOI) from agency heads or their representatives for their staff to apply. This replaces the previous requirement of a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), simplifying access to the program based on feedback from GSIS members.\nVeloso noted that these improvements highlight GSIS's dedication to offering flexible financial options to its members. He added that the Ginhawa Max Loan Buyout is part of the GSIS Ginhawa Series, which also includes Ginhawa Flex and Ginhawa Lite.\nGovernment employees interested in applying can schedule appointments using the GSIS Touch mobile app. They need to prepare their most recent payslip and documentation for the loans they intend to buy out or consolidate.\nEligibility criteria include having at least one posted premium payment within the last six months, no existing Multi-Purpose Loan (MPL) or defaulted GSIS Financial Assistance Loans, no pending administrative or criminal cases, and meeting the net take-home pay requirements as stipulated in the General Appropriations Act.

investments-in-philippines-soars-71-since-mid-2022-fueled-by-renewable-energy	Investments in Philippines soars 71% since mid-2022, fueled by renewable energy	The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) reported a 71 percent surge in approved investments to ₱3.54 trillion under the Marcos administration from July 2022 to April 2025, driven largely by renewable energy projects.\nIn a statement, Trade Secretary Cristina A. Roque said the total includes record-breaking annual figures of ₱729 billion in 2022, ₱1.26 trillion in 2023, and ₱1.62 trillion in 2024, the highest in the Board of Investments' (BOI) 57-year history. \nRoque said that these figures are a testament to the Philippines’ sound investment policies and the leadership of President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. in building an innovation-driven economy.\nWhile 2025 has seen a slowdown in investment approvals, the DTI explained that this is a natural part of the investment cycle as many previously approved large-scale projects move into the implementation phase.\nThe department added that external factors, such as tighter global financial conditions and geopolitical uncertainty, have also contributed to a more cautious investment environment.\nRoque noted that large-scale projects like offshore wind farms and energy infrastructure require detailed planning and construction, which do not result in immediate foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows but are critical for long-term growth.\nBetween January 2022 and February 2025, the Philippines experienced fluctuating FDI inflows, which were influenced by global economic conditions. \nDespite these fluctuations, the DTI reported that manufacturing, real estate, and information and communication remained the top sectors for FDI. \nThe department noted that the recent downtrend in FDIs is not unique to the Philippines, aligning with a broader global and regional trend. \nThe ongoing US-China trade war has also influenced investor behavior, particularly in the IT-BPM sector, prompting firms to reassess investment timelines.\nTo further promote the Philippines as an investment destination, the BOI launched the CREATE MORE Roadshows in March 2025 and conducted the Philippine Business Forum in Seoul, South Korea, in April 2025. \nThe BOI is also finalizing the 2025 Strategic Investment Priority Plan (SIPP) and has implemented Executive Order No. 18 to establish "Green Lanes" for strategic investments, streamlining permit applications.\nAs of May 27, 2025, 208 projects have received Green Lane certification, 78 percent of which are in renewable energy, totaling ₱5.2 trillion in investment value.

Record-breaking annual figures were seen in 2022, 2023, and 2024, reaching the highest in the BOI's history.  While 2025 shows a slowdown, this is attributed to projects entering implementation and global economic factors.

jollibee-hints-at-possible-highlands-coffee-ipo-after-years-of-delay	Jollibee hints at possible Highlands Coffee IPO after years of delay	After years of delay, Jollibee Foods Corporation is now more upbeat about the prospects for an initial public offering of its highly profitable and rapidly expanding Highlands Coffee business which is the dominant coffee chain in Vietnam.\nIn an online media briefing, Jollibee Chief Financial Officer Richard Shin said “the numberic says it can go IPO but we don’t want to just go IPO for the sake of IPO. When we take this to a capital market opportunity to create value for shareholders, we want to be very thoughtful and think about the best way we can move forward.”\n“We are, of course, always thinking about ways to optimize some of these investments that we’ve made. But Highlands Coffee going IPO in Vietnam as a standalone company is not something that we believe is the best way to take this forward,” he noted.\nShin did not elaborate on how they plan to structure a future IPO for Highlands Coffee and whether they will place it in a holding company with the group’s other coffee chains or food businesses overseas.\nHe pointed out, though, that the group has grown the business from 56 unprofitable stores in 2012 to almost 900 branches now that are “extremely profitable.”\nAccording to Shin, the coffee business in Vietnam has recovered from recent macroeconomic headwinds related to China, as Vietnam’s economy is heavily dependent on the Chinese economy.\n“But we’ve now been seeing positive growth again for Highland, so that’s fantastic, and the market is good and, lucky for us, over that time, we never stepped back,” he said.\nShin said “We continue to build new stores, and we continue to believe in the brand. It was dominant back then and, today, roughly our dominance equates to around the next four coffee and tea brands put together.\n“So we’re very satisfied with the strategy we took to not pull back due to fear, but to really understand that it was just cyclical and temporary, and we kept on pushing forward.”\nHe also responded to concerns over rising coffee bean prices by pointing out that all of Jollibee’s coffee businesses continue to enjoy high margins.

investment-banking-in-the-digital-age-navigating-the-future-of-capital-markets	Investment Banking in the Digital Age: Navigating the future of capital markets	By Ed Francisco, BDO Capital President; Karlo Lim, BDO Capital Sr. Associate; and Andrew Poblete, BDO Capital Associate\nBDO Equitable Tower\nThe investment banking industry is undergoing a gradual but impactful transformation. What was once a highly manual, paper-driven process characterized by chalkboards, floor runners, and physical coupons for interest payments has given way to a fully digital ecosystem. Technology has redefined how capital is raised, trades are executed, and information is consumed, placing unprecedented power in the hands of both issuers and investors.\nToday, digital platforms allow individuals to trade and invest with ease, anytime and anywhere, using only their smartphones or laptops. This convenience is driven by significant advances in software, data infrastructure, and connectivity, making financial markets more accessible, transparent, and responsive to real-time developments. At the same time, the explosion of online information from corporate disclosures to financial news and even market speculation has reshaped investor behavior. Digitalization has not only democratized access to capital markets but has also heightened the demand for speed, efficiency, and insight.\nIn this fast-changing environment, companies face growing complexity: adapting to new regulations, engaging with digitally savvy investors, and staying competitive in a fintech-driven world.\nInvestment banks like BDO Capital & Investment Corporation are helping businesses meet these challenges head-on. By integrating technology into their sales, distribution, and operations processes, they are expanding market participation and enabling more efficient capital raising. Whether it's simplifying bond listings through electronic submission platforms or leveraging digital tools for broader investor outreach, the role of investment banks is evolving to become not just dealmakers, but digital enablers of growth.\nDigital Innovation is Reshaping Capital Markets\nFor bond issuances, investment banks have embraced innovations such as the e-Securities Issue Portal (e-SIP), which enables the fully digital submission of corporate bond listing requirements with the Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corporation (PDEx). This transition has replaced the once paper-heavy, redundant process with a more streamlined and efficient approach. In the equity space, platforms like PSE Easy now allow Local Small Investors (LSIs) to subscribe to offerings conveniently through digital trading apps, further encouraging broader retail participation.\nLooking ahead, the next frontier lies in developing a centralized digital bond exchange, a platform that would make investing in bonds as seamless as buying stocks, eliminating excessive documentation and unlocking easier access for all investor segments. Even the public sector is accelerating this momentum. After the launch of Bonds.ph, which enabled online subscriptions to Retail Treasury Bonds (RTBs), the Bureau of the Treasury announced plans to issue RTBs in smaller denominations via mobile app. These innovations reflect a broader shift toward accessibility and inclusion in capital markets.\nInvestment houses, including BDO Capital, are at the forefront of this evolution. By adopting platforms like e-SIP and supporting digital innovation across issuances, BDO Capital is helping issuers connect with today’s technology-driven investors while reinforcing trust and operational efficiency—core pillars in the modern investment landscape.\nDigitalization Driving Market Transformation\nDigitalization continues to reshape the Philippine dealmaking landscape, a trend accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and now deeply embedded in how businesses operate and grow. The rise of local venture capital firms, such as Gentree Fund is poised to accelerate the adoption of technology across both consumer markets and the investment banking sector. It has actively backed early-stage tech ventures particularly in e-commerce and digital infrastructure, laying the groundwork for the next wave of mergers, acquisitions, and potential public listings. While many of these startups remain in their growth phases, their scaling trajectory suggests that more tech-enabled companies will soon be primed for capital market participation.\nAs technology continues to disrupt financial services from AI-powered deal modeling to fintech-driven payments, companies need advisors who can bridge traditional finance with the digital economy. BDO Capital, for example, has consistently supported clients exploring acquisitions or partnerships in the tech space, demonstrating a strong grasp of both the investor landscape and the evolving digital ecosystem.\nInvestment banks that understand these dynamics are uniquely positioned to advise companies on scaling, consolidating, or tapping into public markets. With a deep market insight and digital capability, BDO Capital is well-positioned to guide businesses in seizing these opportunities. The bank also sees Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a game changer—streamlining internal workflows and enabling its bankers to focus more on strategy and value creation for clients.

maynilad-charts-path-to-cut-costly-non-revenue-water	Maynilad charts path to cut costly non-revenue water	BORACAY—West Zone concessionaire Maynilad Water Services Inc. is on track to reduce its non-revenue water (NRW) from last year’s 39.9 percent on the back of strong leak detection and pipe replacement efforts.\nMaynilad, the country’s biggest water concessionaire in terms of customer base, is eyeing to bring down its NRW level to 34 percent this year.\nIn a media forum here, Maynilad Central NRW Head Ryan Jamora said the rate currently stands at 36.2 percent as of the first quarter.\nMaynilad defines NRW as the difference between the amount of water a utility puts into a distribution system and the amount it bills to customers.\nNRW is primarily driven by water leaks, illegal connections, inaccurate metering and billing, unauthorized withdrawal from fire hydrants, and unbilled authorized use.\nGiven the factors at play, including prevention schemes and other expenses, the revenue cost of the NRW has not yet been defined by the company.\nJamora, however, said a clear consequence of this include insufficient water pressure, persistent supply disruptions, quality concerns, and even road deterioration caused by surfacing leaks.\nNRW, which incurs physical and commercial losses, has been a thorn to the west zone concession since it was privatized in 1997, standing at 67 percent.\nDuring the early years of the company, under the Lopez group, minimal investments were seen in addressing water losses.\nOnly when the group of tycoon Manuel V. Pangilinan took the reins of Maynilad in 2007 when significant efforts were made to bring down NRW.\nAs specified under its 2023-2027 business plan approved by the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS), Maynilad is targeting an average of 25 percent by 2027 and 20 percent by 2030.\nTo keep on track of its target of 34 percent for 2025, the water firm has approximately spent ₱1.15 billion on various upgrades and mitigation measures.\nAs of March 31, a total of 18,070 pipe leaks have been repaired. This keeps the company on course to match or even surpass the total of 57,562 leaks it repaired in 2024.\nMaynilad is expected to further amplify through advanced technologies such as correlators, acoustic loggers, and ground microphones across its metered areas.\nIt has likewise committed to implement more targeted pipe replacement projects to further cut water losses.\nSince the inception of the MWSS-approved plan, Maynilad has spent a total of ₱11.96 billion on NRW management. This is 39 percent of the planned funding of ₱31 billion from 2023 to 2027.	"\\tImages/maynilad-charts-path-to-cut-costly-non-revenue-water_1.png,Images/maynilad-charts-path-to-cut-costly-non-revenue-water_2.png"	Maynilad aims to reduce its non-revenue water (NRW) from 39.9 percent to 34 percent in 2025.  The company is investing ₱1.15 billion in upgrades and repairs, having already fixed 18,070 leaks.  Maynilad plans to utilize advanced technologies and targeted pipe replacements to further minimize water losses.  By 2030, the target is to achieve a 20 percent NRW rate.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/04/maynilad-charts-path-to-cut-costly-non-revenue-water
local-motorcycle-sales-surge-past-700000-mark-at-end-may	Local motorcycle sales surge past 700,000 mark at end-May	The Philippines’ motorcycle industry remains on an upward trajectory, with sales surging past 700,000 by the end of May, as demand for greater mobility and an affordable mode of transportation continues to sweep the nation.\nThe latest figures from the Federation of Asian Motorcycle Industries (FAMI) showed that 746,016 motorcycles were sold in the country from January to May, representing an eight percent increase from 688,790 in the same period in 2024.\nTaking into account May alone, it posted 150,781 units sold compared to 144,210 in the same month last year.\nLast month registered the second-highest number of sales in the motorcycle industry this year, with January still leading with 155,715 units sold, due to strong holiday spending.\nFAMI’s data, sourced from the Motorcycle Development Program Participants Association Inc. (MDPPA), showed that domestic production by the end of April recorded 476,405 units—12 percent higher than 425,946 during the first four months of 2024.\nMDPPA’s figures were sourced from the local subsidiaries of four giant Japanese motorcycle brands—Honda, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and Yamaha—along with the Indian brand TVS.\nThe group accounts for approximately 80 to 90 percent of domestic motorcycle sales and production.\nRizal Commercial Banking Corp. (RCBC) Chief Economist Michael Ricafort said the continued increase in motorcycle sales and production this year is a testament to the strong consumer demand for more affordable alternatives to passenger cars.\n“Motorcycles are also more economical to use in terms of fuel consumption and maintenance costs compared to larger vehicles,” said Ricafort.\nAside from its affordability compared to other vehicles, motorcycles allow riders to better maneuver through heavy traffic, as they require less space on the road.\n“Increased sales in recent months could also reflect greater demand for motorcycle taxis and delivery services, as a source of new/additional livelihood for more Filipinos in recent years,” added Ricafort.\nThe economist, however, noted that there could be a slowdown in the future once the reciprocal tariffs of the United States (US) are reimposed next month, which could drive market uncertainties.\nThe tariffs and other trade disputes were earlier cited as a factor in the slow growth in vehicle sales in April.\nA joint report by the Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines Inc. (CAMPI) and the Truck Manufacturers Association (TMA) showed that sales in the first four months of the year reached 150,654 units, a 2.5 percent hike from 146,920 units during the same period last year—the slowest growth in seven months.\nAmong FAMI’s seven member-associations, Indonesia’s sales topped the list with 2,089,953 units sold. These figures cover only the first four months of the year.\nThe Philippines, with five months of data, ranked second.\nVietnam, which releases sales data every quarter, placed third with 673,055 units sold in the first quarter of 2025.\nBased on the first five months of the year, motorcycle sales this year are on track to outpace the record-high 1,704,898 units sold in 2019.\nFAMI data showed that 2019 motorcycle sales stood at 691,739 by the end of May, which is eight percent lower than the reported 746,016 units in 2025.\nLast year, over 1.68 million motorcycle units were sold in the country, with production reaching 1.25 million units.	"\\tImages/local-motorcycle-sales-surge-past-700000-mark-at-end-may_1.png"	Philippine motorcycle sales surged past 700,000 by end-May, an 8% increase from the same period in 2024.  May sales reached 150,781 units, second only to January's 155,715 units.  This growth reflects strong consumer demand for affordable transportation and increased use in delivery services.

leading-ad-experts-converge-at-ccip-for-high-impact-discussions	Leading ad experts converge at CCIP for high-impact discussions	The Chamber of Cosmetics Industry of the Philippines (CCIP) convened its 2nd General Membership Meeting (GMM) on June 4, 2025, at the World Trade Center, drawing beauty industry leaders and advertising luminaries for a dynamic "Advertising Minds: An Advertising Forum." The event, moderated by Denice Sy, Chief Sales & Marketing Officer of Ever Bilena Cosmetics, Inc., transcended a typical industry gathering, fostering a crucial exchange on the evolving landscape of effective advertising.\nBetsy Baking's presentation covers the different perspectives of beauty across generations.\nThe forum featured an esteemed panel of experts, including Tats Cruz (Chief Creative Agencies Officer, Publicis Groupe Philippines), Robbie Aligada (Executive Director, Ad Standards Council - ASC), Betsy Baking (Managing Partner, Over the Moon Communications), Third Domingo (Chief Creative Officer & Chairman, Hakuhodo Asia Pacific / IdeasXMachina), and Nicole Morales (President & Founder, The Beauty Edit). Together, they delved into how modern advertising functions not merely as a business tool but as a powerful cultural force.\nPurpose, people, and authentic storytelling\nA recurring theme was the imperative of understanding consumers and a brand's core purpose. Tats Cruz emphasized that compelling campaigns resonate when they speak to consumers in a relatable language, positioning products as genuine solutions. She highlighted the growing demand for clarity and authenticity, particularly from younger generations. Third Domingo echoed this, asserting that creativity stems from a mindset rooted in a clear founder's purpose.\nNicole Morales, whose journey from beauty editor to founder of The Beauty Edit offers a unique perspective, underscored the power of storytelling. "Successful brands today identify a gap and tell a story around it. It’s not just about product benefits—it’s about positioning yourself with purpose," she stated. Morales also pointed to the agility and authenticity of indie brands, noting the exciting potential for "F-beauty" (Filipino beauty) in categories like upscale Filipino haircare and locally crafted perfumes.\nBig ideas beyond big budgets\nAddressing concerns about limited marketing budgets, Betsy Baking offered an encouraging perspective. She asserted that a "champion product, a champion promise, and a champion idea" can enable a campaign to succeed regardless of cost. Baking highlighted that today's consumers, particularly on platforms like TikTok, often prioritize authenticity over high production value, with "co-created, real content" driving conversions.\nCompliance, truth, and 'return on heart'\nRobbie Aligada of the Ad Standards Council clarified that while not all cosmetics advertising requires pre-screening, honesty remains paramount. He stressed that compliance is a principle, not a burden, and that "advertising should always be honest, fair, and accurate." In a memorable moment, Aligada introduced a new metric for marketers: "ROH – Return on Heart," suggesting that conversion extends beyond sales to encompass belief, trust, and brand goodwill.\nNavigating the quest for virality\nThe panel also critically examined the pursuit of virality. Third Domingo cautioned that "viral content is the best way to kill a bad product," advising brands to prioritize relevance over widespread reach and ensure their message and product are fully prepared before seeking mass attention. Both Tats Cruz and Betsy Baking reinforced that intentional, clear, and culturally grounded strategies often yield more sustainable brand traction than fleeting viral stunts.\nAdvertising: The cost of existence\nWhen asked about the hesitation to invest in advertising, the panelists were unanimous: advertising is a fundamental necessity. "Advertising is not just a cost of promotion," Domingo stated, "It’s the cost of existing. Having a brand name, a logo, a story—that’s all advertising. The question isn’t if you should advertise, but how well you’re doing it." The experts encouraged businesses to leverage in-house capabilities and collaborate with agencies to elevate their creative output.\nIn her closing remarks, Denice Sy encapsulated the forum's core message: "It’s not just about visibility.

map-urges-govt-to-prioritize-price-reduction-over-wage-hike	MAP urges gov't to prioritize price reduction over wage hike	The Management Association of the Philippines (MAP) is urging the government to focus on reducing high costs across commodities and services to alleviate the burden on minimum-wage-earning Filipino workers and their families.\nMAP, comprising the country’s leading business executives, stated that the executive and legislative branches of the government should focus their attention on the unbalanced wage-to-cost ratio nationwide.\n“We have the third highest minimum wage in Asia, and some of the highest costs—especially of food, power, transportation, and housing,” MAP said.\n“Our basic problem is not low wages, but high costs,” it added.\nThe influential business group stated it does not support the recent passage of the proposed ₱200 daily minimum wage increase in the House of Representatives.\nWhile MAP said it supports initiatives to improve the lives of minimum-wage workers, the group argues that the proposed wage hike necessitates further review and consultation.\n“We, in the [MAP], support initiatives that help improve the lives of all minimum-wage earning Filipino workers and their families. However, we do not support the ₱200 daily wage increase which was approved recently by the House of Representatives,” it said.\nMAP said the bicameral conference committee—comprising the Senate and the House—should conduct further consultations with all affected sectors before reaching a decision.\nSince many factors have to be taken into account, the group emphasized the need to include the views of employers, employees, consumers, and government agencies.\nMAP likewise urged the committee to consider the potential impact of the proposed wage hike on inflation and business sustainability.\nIt noted that this could particularly impact the millions of small enterprises that “struggle just to survive.”\n“We also suggest that it be researched as to whether setting a national minimum wage, or regional ones instead, be considered,” it added.\nAs such, MAP said the government should prioritize reducing costs to help make the Philippines more export-competitive,\nThe group, headed by its president Al Panlilio, said there should be a strong push to address “inefficiencies across all sectors to improve overall productivity and reduce all forms of waste.”\n“We also make an appeal to employers to help alleviate the plight of the minimum-wage earners by implementing urgent measures, like paying their employees’ share in SSS, Pag-IBIG and PhilHealth contributions, sharing with their employees at least 20 percent of their organizations’ net income before tax, among others,” said MAP.\nAside from MAP, other business groups such as the Makati Business Club (MBC), the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCCI), and the Employers’ Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP) have expressed their opposition to the House-approved wage hike measure.

it-bpm-sector-eyes-40-billion-in-2025-despite-us-tariff-threat	IT-BPM sector eyes $40 billion in 2025 despite US tariff threat	The country’s information technology and business process management (IT-BPM) sector is on track to reach $40 billion in revenues this year as investor confidence in the industry remains robust despite the looming threat of the United States’ (US) tariff policy.\nIT and Business Process Association of the Philippines (IBPAP), the country’s leading IT-BPM group, said the projected growth in 2025 is five-percent higher than the $38 billion the industry recorded last year.\nIBPAP is also projecting a four-percent growth in employees, from 1.82 million in 2024 to 1.9 million this year.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIBPAP President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jack Madrid is confident that the local industry will reach these numbers as it has yet to see any direct impact from the protectionist policies of the US.\n“As of this time, we still see more demand for offshoring to the Philippines from North America, more than we can supply,” said Madrid.\n“I think we need to continue to take advantage of this mismatch and work on the upskilling so that we can maximize our market share,” he added.\nUnlike the first term of US President Donald Trump where the IT-BPM sector was affected, Madrid said the industry is significantly stronger to cushion potential impacts of Trump’s new tariff policy during his second term.\nHe explained that it would be harder for companies that are currently offshoring in the Philippines to transfer their workers elsewhere.\n“I think the Philippines' position has become stronger in the past 10 years,” the official said.\n“It's more complex. I think the employers and the investors know that. Where are you going to move this work? It's certainly hard to move it back to the US,” he noted.\nCurrently, North America, which includes the US, is still the top region investing in the local industry, comprising a dominant 70 percent of the total number.\nMadrid said the industry is keen on attracting destinations outside the region, particularly in other English-speaking countries such as Australia.\nThe local talent pool’s strong proficiency in the English language has long been cited as one of the most vital assets for companies looking to expand in the Philippines.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Aside from English, I think we also need to talk about our agents' domain skills…I think the success of the industry will be not just about our communication and English fluency but also our strength in domain skills,” he said.\nManila Bulletin reported earlier that foreign investors in the renewable energy (RE) sector are slowly moving away from the country due to regulatory restrictions, particularly at the level of local government units (LGUs).\nSought for comment, Madrid said the industry is largely unaffected by this trend, noting that a new locator and investor visits his office every week.\nHowever, on the part of its members, IBPAP Chief Operating Officer (COO) Celeste Ilagan said there are IT-BPM firms that are still encountering problems with certain LGUs.\nIlagan said these concerns were supposed to be addressed by the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises to Maximize Opportunities for Reinvigorating the Economy (CREATE MORE) Act, which was enacted last year.\n“It really revolves around how the LGUs interpret the provisions of CREATE MORE in terms of incentives that the enterprises are entitled to. So these problems with LGUs continue to be there,” she said.\nIn particular, Ilagan noted that under CREATE MORE, a company is already paying the two-percent tax on gross income, meaning they will no longer pay other fees and charges.\nSome LGUs, however, continue to impose their respective fees and charges through their own ordinances.\nIlagan said there is a proposed joint memorandum circular by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), the Department of Finance (DOF), and the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) to help address these concerns.\nThe circular would order LGUs how they should follow the imposition of fees, charges, and other requirements related to government permits and other documents.	"\\tImages/it-bpm-revenues-seen-hitting-40-billion-in-2025_1.png"	The Philippines' IT-BPM sector is projected to reach $40 billion in revenue by 2025, a 5% increase from 2024.  Despite US tariff threats, demand for offshoring remains high, exceeding the Philippines' capacity.  The industry's strength and complexity make relocation difficult for companies.  However, some IT-BPM firms face challenges with local government units regarding fees and incentives.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/10/it-bpm-revenues-seen-hitting-40-billion-in-2025

infrawatch-ph-urges-sec-to-plug-enforcement-gaps-vs-unlicensed-crypto-exchanges	Infrawatch PH urges SEC to plug enforcement gaps vs. unlicensed crypto exchanges	Public policy group Infrawatch PH is calling on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to close enforcement gaps on unlicensed crypto exchanges amid the recent launch of the Commission’s strategic surveillance and enforcement sandbox (StratBox).\nThe group said that while StratBox marks progress in cryptocurrency regulation, it must be paired with firmer efforts to close enforcement gaps that enable unregistered platforms to facilitate fraud and abuse.\nThis statement was issued even as the SEC announced that it has just issued new rules to regulate the marketing, issuance, and trading of crypto-assets, as well as the registration and operation of crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) in the country.\nIn October last year, Infrawatch also called on the SEC to take swift action against two unregistered cryptocurrency exchanges, alleging they operate illegally in the Philippines.\nInfrawatch convenor Terry Ridon said StratBox, which allows licensed CASPs to test new products and services under regulatory supervision, is a timely move to promote innovation in the country’s digital asset ecosystem.\n“The sandbox model supports innovation but only for regulated and licensed entities. The use of crypto for illicit activities remains rampant particularly on unregulated and unlicensed firms, and the government should crackdown on firms operating in the Philippine market,” he said.\nStratBox, which opened applications in May, is designed to give registered crypto firms a controlled environment to develop and deploy digital financial products while allowing regulators to assess associated risks.\n“If the SEC seeks strict compliance from licensed cryptocurrency exchanges, it should undertake stronger measures to crackdown on unlicensed exchanges operating in the Philippines, particularly through advisories warning the public against investing in these firms,” Ridon said.\nUnlicensed platforms, he said, are often used to facilitate online scams, money laundering, and other illicit activities—many of which have already victimized Filipino users.\nRidon urged the SEC to work more closely with the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) to implement access restrictions on illegal platforms—similar to the agency’s earlier move to block Binance from operating in the country without proper registration.\n“Compliant players are subject to strict regulatory requirements, while unlicensed entities often operate with fewer restrictions, creating a distorted environment where non-compliance appears more profitable,” Ridon said.\nHe added that, “This sends the wrong signal to the market and undermines confidence in the regulatory framework.”\nRidon noted that any push to develop the digital asset sector must be grounded in a strong system of transparency, accountability, and law enforcement.\n“An emerging crypto environment should be regulated by the government to protect the public interest and investor funds while allowing innovation to thrive.\n“This means crypto entities working with the government through a regulatory framework which gives importance to transparency and accountability while allowing entities to create new products and services to fill various gaps in the market,” he said.

While StratBox, a regulatory sandbox, promotes innovation, stricter measures are needed to curb illegal operations.

The SEC should collaborate with the NTC to restrict access to these illegal platforms, ensuring a fair and transparent market.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/11/infrawatch-ph-urges-sec-to-plug-enforcement-gaps-vs-unlicensed-crypto-exchanges

high-debt-not-a-problem-dof-chief-recto-says-credit-rating-agencies-not-worried-about-philippine-debt-levels	High debt? Not a problem! DOF chief Recto says credit rating agencies 'not worried' about Philippine debt levels	The Marcos Jr. administration's chief economic manager has allayed concerns about the rising public debt level, claiming that the national government maintains prudent fiscal management.\nAsked on Tuesday, June 3, if there's anything to worry about regarding debt accumulation, especially as the nominal amount breaches new highs, Department of Finance (DOF) Secretary Ralph G. Recto told Manila Bulletin: "Credit rating agencies have upgraded us. They're not worried."\nThe Philippines enjoys investment-grade credit ratings from the so-called Big Three debt watchers: Fitch Ratings, Moody's Ratings, and S&P Global Ratings. S&P has currently assigned the Philippines its highest rating—one notch below "A-"—while Moody's and Fitch have given the country the minimum investment grade.\nIn November last year, S&P upgraded the Philippines' credit outlook to "positive," indicating a growing likelihood of a further rating upgrade in the near term. The government is aiming for an "A" rating before the current administration's term ends in 2028.\nAlso, Recto said that "economic growth is faster than the debt."\nBased on the latest Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) data, the national government's outstanding debt as of April 2025 increased 4.4 percent year-to-date from the end-2024 level. But the end-April level jumped 11.6 percent year-on-year, a faster pace than the dismal 5.4-percent gross domestic product (GDP) growth posted in the first quarter of 2025.\nAs Manila Bulletin reported earlier, Moody's recently flagged expectations that the Philippines' debt as a share to economic output would stay elevated in the coming years. "Debt-to-GDP will remain higher than pre-pandemic levels, and debt affordability, measured by general government (GG) interest payments to revenue ratio, will continue to weaken over the next two years," Moody's said last March 1, following its periodic review of the Philippines' credit rating—currently at "Baa2," one notch above investment grade, with a "stable" outlook.\nAt the end of the first quarter of 2025, the debt-to-GDP ratio climbed to 62 percent—the highest since the previous Duterte administration ramped up borrowings at the height of the pandemic to fight the health and socioeconomic crises wrought by Covid-19.\nThe Marcos Jr. administration aims to reduce debt-to-GDP to below 60 percent by the time the President steps down in 2028. Before the Covid-19 pandemic struck, the public debt ratio fell to a record low of 39.6 percent in 2019.\nAs for GG debt—the metric that credit rating agencies monitor for their ratings actions, as it excludes intragovernmental debt holdings—the latest Department of Finance (DOF) data showed its ratio slightly improved to 53.6 percent in 2023 from a high of 54.2 percent in 2022.\nCredit ratings assess a government's creditworthiness and reflect financial stability, serving as a proxy indicator of economic health. An investment-grade rating enables the government to borrow at lower interest rates, which can translate into reduced borrowing costs for businesses and consumers.\nThe latest BTr report on the national government's outstanding debt, released on June 3, showed that the pile inched up to a new high of ₱16.75 trillion as of the end of April.\nIt was in April that the BTr raised ₱300 billion from its new 10-year, fixed-rate benchmark bonds offering, but overall debt accumulation was tempered by the relatively stronger peso against the soft United States (US) dollar, limiting the month-on-month increase to only 0.41 percent.\nBy end-2025, the government's outstanding debt is projected to climb to a record ₱17.35 trillion.\nBeyond the BTr press release, the latest updated data on its website showed that its claims of a "disciplined debt strategy" by the national government may be true, after all.\nAlso posted on the BTr website at the same time as the press statement was released, debt indicators as of April 2025 showed that the majority of the record-high debts, amounting to ₱11.49 trillion, were denominated in peso—up 1.9 percent month-on-month.\nMeanwhile, foreign currency-denominated debt declined by 2.7 percent month-on-month to $94.17 billion, equivalent to ₱5.27 trillion, at end-April.\nThe Philippines borrows more from the liquid domestic debt market—and in the local currency—mainly through the weekly issuance of treasury bills and bonds not only to take advantage of domestic creditors who are awash in cash, but also to temper foreign exchange (forex) risks for future repayments.\nMore than two-thirds of the outstanding debt had been locally sourced.\nBack in April, National Treasurer Sharon P. Almanza told Manila Bulletin that the government is unlikely to issue more global bonds, unless the budget deficit ceiling is raised. Of the $3.5 billion programmed for global bond issuances in 2025, $3.3 billion was already raised last January. As such, any further issuance may amount to only $200 million, Almanza had said.\nThe government plans to borrow a gross amount of ₱2.55 trillion this year, with only ₱507.4 billion of the programmed 2025 financing from external sources.\nThis also shows in the profile of end-April 2025 outstanding debt by type of instrument: debt securities issued by the BTr here and abroad accounted for ₱14.27 trillion, while the remainder amounting to ₱2.48 trillion were concessional loans extended by bilateral development partners as well as multilateral lenders.\nA closer look at the end-April BTr debt data showed that while the value of outstanding loans has been quite stable since the end of 2024 and even declined month-on-month from end-March levels, the Philippines has been relying more on debt securities for its financing requirements, at least during the past four months.\nBreaking down debt by maturity, long-term borrowings that will be repaid in 10 or more years accounted for over 82 percent of total, amounting to ₱13.74 trillion. The share of long-term debt to total has also been rising these past few years and months.\nShort-term debts payable in a year or less reached ₱820.3 billion as of April, accounting for 4.9 percent of total; while medium-term obligations amounted to ₱2.19 trillion, or 13.1 percent of the outstanding public debt pile.	"\\tImages/high-debt-not-a-problem-dof-chief-recto-says-credit-rating-agencies-not-worried-about-philippine-debt-levels_1.png"	Finance Secretary Recto assures that credit rating agencies are not worried about the Philippines' rising debt, citing recent upgrades and the fact that economic growth outpaces debt increase.  The country's debt-to-GDP ratio reached 62 percent in Q1 2025, the highest since the pandemic.  The government aims to lower this to below 60 percent by 2028, while maintaining a disciplined debt strategy.  Despite the high debt, the Philippines enjoys investment-grade credit ratings from major agencies.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/04/high-debt-not-a-problem-dof-chief-recto-says-credit-rating-agencies-not-worried-about-philippine-debt-levels

map-sees-positive-shift-with-artas-anti-red-tape-reforms	MAP sees positive shift with ARTA's anti-red tape reforms	The country’s leading business executives are optimistic about the government’s ongoing strategy to enhance the ease of doing business in the Philippines, following the new reform outlook of the Anti-Red Tape Authority (ARTA).\nIn a statement, the Management Association of the Philippines (MAP) commended ARTA over the recent launch of its Philippine Ease of Doing Business (EODB) Reform Guidebook.\nLast month, ARTA officially launched the guidebook as part of the Marcos administration’s initiative to make the country more business-friendly for investors.\nThe agency stated that the guidebook would empower government offices to enhance their regulatory processes, thereby further eliminating potential red tape and corrupt practices.\nMAP, for its part, lauded the guidebook for addressing overlapping mandates among government agencies.\nThe prominent business group stated that this represents a strong commitment from the government to ensure regulatory coherence and inter-agency collaboration.\n“More than a reform tool, the guidebook marks a transformative shift in how government delivers public services,” said MAP.\nIt particularly highlighted the Regulatory Management System (RMS) under the guidebook, which is guided by the principles of clarity, benefit-cost analysis, stakeholder engagement, a whole-of-government approach, competition, legal and empirical grounding, continuous assessment, coherence, ongoing evaluation, and risk management.\nBased on its observation, MAP said the early outcomes of ARTA’s EODB Reform Guidebook among agencies are “encouraging.”\nThey noted that there are improvements in permitting for telecommunications infrastructure, regulatory impact assessments (RIA), and stakeholder engagement.\nNotably, agencies such as the Department of Agriculture (DA) and the Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA) are now adding participatory approaches to align their standards with global standards, as indicated in the guidebook.\n“The guidebook is more than a procedural manual—it stands as a testament to a responsive, forward-looking public sector and serves as a cornerstone for building a more competitive, inclusive, and service-oriented Philippines,” MAP said.

meralco-sees-mixed-movements-in-june-electricity-bills	Meralco sees mixed movements in June electricity bills	Consumers may see mixed movements in their electricity bills this June, according to the Manuel V. Pangilinan-led Manila Electric Co. (Meralco). In a statement sent by Meralco on Thursday, June 5, the distribution utility (DU) attributed this month’s upcoming power rates to a potential increase in the reserve market prices. “We are still waiting for all the final billings from our suppliers for the computation of power rates for the June billing period,” it stated. “Initial information shows a possibility of an increase in the transmission charge due to a possible uptick in reserve market prices for the May supply month in comparison with the previous month based on publicly available data,” Meralco further explained. Transmission charges are the fees for delivering electricity from power plants to DUs through National Grid Corp. of the Philippines’ (NGCP) network. Reserve market prices, on the other hand, affect the ancillary service (AS) rates of the transmission grid operator, and will then reflect in consumers’ prices. “In terms of the generation charge, we hope it remains flattish and that there will be no significant movement for the June billing month following the significant decrease last May,” it added. Meralco hoped that potential price increases could be offset by the lower rates found in the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM). Earlier this week, the average spot market price saw a significant 11-percent drop to ₱4.11 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), as reported by the Independent Electricity Market Operator of the Philippines (IEMOP). “We also hope that the continued implementation of the ₱19.96-billion refund, which was approved by the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC), will help mitigate possible increases in power bill components,” Meralco added. To recall, the ERC ordered Meralco to refund ₱19.95 billion to its customers over a 36-month period starting April, following the approval of a provisional authority. The refund, equivalent to around ₱0.1189/kWh across customer classes, covers over recoveries in electricity rates from July 1, 2022, to Dec. 31, 2024. Last month, Meralco announced a ₱0.7499/kWh drop in its power rates, resulting in a ₱12.2628/kWh decline in the overall rate for a typical household.

A significant drop in the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market price offers potential offsetting factors.  Meralco also anticipates the ongoing ₱19.96-billion refund to help mitigate possible increases. Last month saw a substantial decrease in power rates.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/05/meralco-sees-mixed-movements-in-june-electricity-bills
growth-potential-seen-in-seaweed-amid-rising-plastic-pollution-unctad	Growth potential seen in seaweed amid rising plastic pollution—UNCTAD	As the world grapples with the continued rise of plastic pollution across marine and freshwater ecosystems, developing economies such as the Philippines are ramping up the production of non-plastic alternatives, with seaweed as a major source.\nIn its latest global trade update, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) pointed out that plastics make up around 80 percent of ocean pollution, covering large garbage patches to microplastics that threatens marine ecosystems.\nIt is estimated that 75 to 199 million metric tons (MT) of plastics are present in the ocean, with an additional eight to 10 million MT being added each year.\nDespite the serious threat it poses to marine ecosystems and human health, plastic materials and plastic-based goods continue to be robust. In fact, it accounted nearly four percent of global trade in 2022, reaching a record $1.2 trillion.\nGiven its significant risks, many countries are slowly shifting their priorities into becoming more sustainable, particularly aligned with efforts to curb climate change.\nUNCTAD said there is an upward trajectory in the exports of non-plastic substitutes such as natural fibers, biomaterials, and glass.\nIt noted that in 2022, global trade in substitutes reached $560 billion, rising 30-percent faster than plastic trade between 2005 and 2022.\nDeveloping economies, including the Philippines, accounted for 42 percent of the exports of these alternative goods.\nMajority of these countries are harnessing seaweed, which can be transformed into a substitute to plastic, such as food packaging.\nUNCTAD data showed that the global seaweed industry has steadily grown over the past two decades, reaching more than 36.3 million MT of wet weight by 2022.\nTrade in seaweed and other algae, whether fit for human consumption or other uses nearly doubled between 2012 and 2022, jumping from $677 million to $1.2 billion.\nWith seaweed accounting for half of global marine aquaculture production by volume, China led the list of the top seaweed-producing countries by production volume, reaching 22.4 million MT.\nNeighboring country Indonesia ranked second with 9.2 million MT.\nThe Philippines is not far behind, producing 1.5 million MT, only behind South Korea with 1.7 million MT.\nIn the export front, UNCTAD said Indonesia topped the global seaweed trade in 2023, reaching $400 million. The country’s seaweed industry is valued at over $1 billion.\nThe Philippines, meanwhile, ranked eighth with $18 million. During the reference period, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) said the country produced 228,570 MT of seaweed, valued at $218.60 million.\nThe country’s low ranking is a steep fall from being the world’s top seaweed producer over a decade ago.\nThe Department of Agriculture (DA) previously noted that Indonesia overtook the top spot from the Philippines in 2009, when it produced 2.79 million MT of seaweeds, compared to the country’s 1.7 million MT.\nLast year, seaweed production was estimated at 1.46 million MT, 11-percent lower than the 2023 output of 1.63 million MT.\nWith the growth potential in non-plastic alternatives, the government is ramping up its initiatives to strengthen the local seaweed industry.\nThe Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR), an attached agency of the DA, earlier allocated ₱1.06 billion to fund this year’s implementation of the enhanced Philippine seaweed development program (EPSDP).\nAgriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel said last year that there is a “significant growth potential” for seaweed farming, especially with BFAR identifying 64,000 hectares (ha) for farming that could increase annual output by 50 percent.\nUNCTAD, in its report, noted that the seaweed industry remains underdeveloped and underregulated, with challenges such as limited support, weak coordination, and the lack of standardization and dedicated governance.\nTo lead global efforts in strengthening the sector, the co-chairs of the Fifth UN Ocean Forum has proposed the creation of a UN seaweed task force.\nUNCTAD said this task force would coordinate efforts to maximize support for trade, sustainable and equitable production, and multiple uses of seaweed.	"\\tImages/growth-potential-seen-in-seaweed-amid-rising-plastic-pollutionunctad_1.png"	Global seaweed industry growth is seen as a solution to rising plastic pollution, with developing economies leading the way.  The UNCTAD report highlights seaweed's potential as a sustainable alternative to plastic in various applications, like food packaging.  Despite Indonesia's current lead in seaweed export value, the Philippines aims to revitalize its seaweed industry with government initiatives.  Challenges remain, including underdevelopment and underregulation of the sector, which necessitates a coordinated global effort.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/05/growth-potential-seen-in-seaweed-amid-rising-plastic-pollutionunctad
marcos-admin-prudently-manages-larger-debt-left-by-duterte-govt-dof	Marcos admin prudently manages 'larger' debt left by Duterte gov't—DOF	The Department of Finance (DOF) said the Marcos administration has been prudently managing the Philippines’ swollen debt stock, which was bloated by the ₱6.84 trillion added by the Duterte regime during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nIn a statement released on Thursday, June 5, the DOF said the national government “continues to manage the large debt it has inherited from the previous administration by growing the economy faster.”\nEfforts contributing to this debt management, the DOF said, have brought down the country’s debt to a “sustainable level” and below the 70-percent international threshold for the debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio.\nReports from the DOF showed that the Duterte administration left ₱12.79 trillion in debt. From this total, the current government’s outstanding debt continued to increase, reaching ₱16.75 trillion as of end-April.\nComparatively, the ₱6.84 trillion in debt accumulated under the previous administration exceeded the total borrowings of all past presidents from Ferdinand Marcos Sr. to Benigno Aquino III, the DOF noted.\nThe DOF argued that “despite inheriting the larger debt stock,” the current government has already trimmed the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio to 60.7 percent last year. The government aims to reduce this further to below 60 percent by the end of the Marcos administration in 2028.\nThe DOF is confident the government can meet this target, citing the rapid growth of the economy, which it said is outpacing the increase in debt. It projects the country’s GDP to reach ₱36.8 trillion by 2028.\nAs of end-April, domestic debt accounted for 69.2 percent of the country’s total debt, while foreign debt comprised 30.8 percent. This fell short of the desired 80:20 borrowing mix—80 percent sourced locally, and 20 percent from foreign lenders.\nThe adoption of this mix, the DOF said, supports the development of local capital markets and helps mitigate foreign exchange risks.\n“Since a large chunk of the borrowing remains local, this means that the interest payments are being circulated back into the economy,” the DOF said.\n“Tax collections continue to post double-digit increases,” it added, noting that this allows the government to fund priority projects “without imposing new taxes on the people and keeping debt growth well within sustainable levels.”\nTax collections climbed by 11.5 percent to ₱1.43 trillion in the first four months of the year, outpacing the 7.6-percent nominal GDP growth in the first quarter—an indication of improving fiscal sustainability, according to the DOF.\nThe Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), the country’s largest tax agency, collected ₱1.11 trillion as of end-April, a 14.5-percent increase from the same period last year.\nMeanwhile, the Bureau of Customs (BOC), the second-largest tax agency, collected ₱306.1 billion, up 2.2 percent year-on-year.\nThe country’s fiscal deficit narrowed to 5.7 percent of GDP in 2024. The DOF said this is projected to decline further to around 3.8 percent by 2028.\nIt also noted that the government’s “strict” commitment to fiscal discipline recently led to a credit rating upgrade to A- from Japan’s Rating and Investment Information Inc. (R&I), along with a positive outlook from S&P Global.\n“Securing a credit rating upgrade and affirmation signals high investor confidence in the Philippines’ economic performance, increasing investor interest in Philippine bonds and resulting in lower borrowing costs for the government,” the DOF said.\nIt added that these borrowings are being reinvested into high-impact sectors such as infrastructure, education, agriculture, health, and social services, which are expected to generate jobs and stimulate further growth.	"\\tImages/marcos-admin-prudently-manages-larger-debt-left-by-duterte-govtdof_1.png"	The Marcos administration is managing the Philippines' large debt inherited from the Duterte administration by growing the economy faster.  The debt-to-GDP ratio has been reduced to 60.7 percent, aiming for below 60 percent by 2028.  Strong tax collections and fiscal discipline contribute to this positive trend, with a recent credit rating upgrade.  These borrowings are reinvested in key sectors to boost growth and employment.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/05/marcos-admin-prudently-manages-larger-debt-left-by-duterte-govtdof
gsis-to-release-june-pensions-two-days-early-on-june-6	GSIS to release June pensions two days early on June 6	The state-run Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) will release the June pension payments two days early, on Friday, June 6, instead of the usual eighth of the month.\nAccording to the GSIS, the adjusted date of release would fall on Eid’l Adha, which has been declared a regular nationwide holiday.\n“Pensioners can conveniently withdraw their pension through ATMs using their UMID [unified multi-purpose ID] or eCard” even during the holiday, the state social insurer said.\nWick Veloso, GSIS president and general manager, said the decision is part of the insurer’s commitment to provide continuous relief to its pensioners.\n“Even on a holiday, they can access their pension easily through ATMs,” Veloso said.\nThe GSIS advises its members and pensioners to stay informed by visiting its official website and following its verified social media accounts.

t-bond-offer-raises-below-target-20-billion-amid-waning-investor-demand-rising-costs	T-bond offer raises below-target ₱20 billion amid waning investor demand, rising costs	The national government has borrowed only ₱19.8 billion from local lenders—well below its ₱30-billion program for Tuesday's treasury bond offering—after rejecting bids with higher interest costs amid weaker demand from investors.\nThe Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) awarded only less than two-thirds of the targeted proceeds through the sale of 15-year bonds. Bids totaled ₱34.5 billion, just slightly higher than planned borrowing.\nThe sale saw a slight increase in interest rates and lower demand from domestic creditors.\nWith a remaining maturity of 13 years and eight months, the bonds were awarded at an average rate of 6.473 percent. This was higher by 6.4 basis points (bps) than the 6.409-percent rate for comparable corporate bonds in the secondary market, based on the PHP Bloomberg Valuation (BVAL) Service Reference Rate.\nRizal Commercial Banking Corp. (RCBC) chief economist Michael L. Ricafort said that the higher interest rates followed the recent upticks in the interest rates of United States (US) treasury bond yields, which was triggered by the downgraded US credit ratings by Moody's.\nRicafort noted that this development also came alongside announcements regarding tax cuts and economic stimulus by US President Donald Trump.\nRaising US treasury yield may also potentially raise borrowing and financing costs globally as governments, corporations, and other major borrowers adjust to spreads above comparable US treasury yields, he noted.\nSome of the offsetting factors, meanwhile, is the central bank’s recent signal of possible two quarter-point rate cuts for the rest of 2025. This is supported by easing inflation and a possible reserve requirement ratio (RRR) cut in 2026.\nAdditionally, the peso has strengthened against the US dollar to its best level in nearly two years, and global crude oil prices have fallen to their lowest in over four years. These factors help lower import costs and overall inflation, potentially allowing for more monetary easing and rate cuts in the coming months, Ricafort said.\nThe Philippines borrows more locally, through treasury bills and bonds, than from foreign sources. This borrowing strategy leverages domestic banks and creditors who are flush with cash, while mitigating exposure to foreign exchange (forex) risks and volatility.\nThe government’s outstanding debt was equivalent to 62 percent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter, its highest level in two years. It climbed from 60.7 percent at the end of 2024.\nSpecifically, domestic debt stood at 42.3 percent of GDP, while foreign debt had a GDP ratio of 19.7 percent.	"\\tImages/t-bond-offer-raises-below-target-20-billion-amid-waning-investor-demand-rising-costs_1.png"	The Philippine government's ₱30 billion treasury bond offering raised only ₱19.8 billion due to weaker investor demand and higher interest costs.  The bonds were awarded at an average rate of 6.473 percent, higher than comparable corporate bonds.  Higher US treasury yields and a Moody's downgrade contributed to the increased rates. Offset factors include potential rate cuts and a stronger peso.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/05/27/t-bond-offer-raises-below-target-20-billion-amid-waning-investor-demand-rising-costs

manila-pushes-codesharing-deals-with-s-korea-japan-to-attract-more-us-tourists	Manila pushes codesharing deals with S. Korea, Japan to attract more US tourists	The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) is seeking to establish new commercial agreements with Korean and Japanese airlines, which would provide American carriers with wider access to the Philippines, thereby driving growth to the country’s popular tourist destinations.\nCAB Executive Director Carmelo Arcilla stated that he recently held talks with airlines from South Korea and Japan regarding agreements that would make travel more seamless for Filipinos.\nHe said this includes third-country codesharing, which would enable airlines from the Philippines and the United States (US) to link with a Korean or Japanese airline to provide a seamless route between the two countries.\nBy harnessing the airlines of the two East Asian countries, Arcilla said it would entice US carriers to operate in the Philippines, given its commercial viability compared to the more costly direct flights.\nFor travelers, third-country codesharing would see a flight to Manila, for instance, be sold as a single ticket.\n“It also has benefits for the customer because the flight will be seamless. You only buy one ticket, you only deal with one entity. They have sharing of lounges, frequent flyer programs. So in terms of marketing and convenience for the passengers, it gives advantages,” Arcilla said in an interview last week.\nThe official stated that expanding access for US carriers is part of the government’s ongoing effort to attract more American tourists to visit the country.\nData from the Department of Tourism (DOT) showed that the US was the country’s second top source of foreign tourists last year, with arrivals increasing to over 1.07 million visitors from 1.04 million in 2023.\nArcilla mentioned that the ongoing “political upheavals” in the US could affect the number of inbound visitors this year. Several reports indicated that America’s new tariff policy is affecting its domestic and international tourism.\nOnce these issues “settled down,” he said this would open a “very big potential” for the local tourism industry.\n“There are many Americans traveling [but] right now, most of the American traffic that we have are Filipino descents,” he noted.\nThe Philippines is looking to attract the interest of Americans from other backgrounds, whose primary destinations would typically be in Europe and South America, as well as the neighboring Canada and Mexico.\nAside from Korean and Japanese airlines, CAB also engaged with an airline from Argentina over the prospects of third-country codesharing and one-stop flights.\nArcilla said many airlines are seeking the greenlight to operate in the Philippines but have been turned away due to the shortage of slots in the country’s main gateway, Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA).\n“But you can just imagine if Bulacan Airport is operational, then we can see a massive growth of traffic,” he said, referring to the San Miguel Corp.-led Manila International Airport (MIA) project in Bulacan, which is eyed to open in 2028.\nMIA is expected to have an initial capacity of 35 million passengers annually, and a target of 100 million passengers per year, once fully completed\nBased on CAB data, air passenger traffic in the country reached 59.9 million in 2024, an 11-percent increase from 53.8 million in the previous year.

(MIC) President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Rafael Consing Jr. said the country’s first and only sovereign wealth fund has recently tied up with Dubai-based logistics company DP World.\nWhile there has been no investment yet, Consing said the MIC is currently studying the potential for a collaboration and even a possible investment in the company.\n“It's more collaborative and an opportunity for us to study opportunities for us to collaborate and see how we can in fact make the movement of goods and people across the nation more efficient,” Consing told reporters.\n“We can make the recommendations by the end of the year, [including] expenses, investment and infrastructure,” he added.\nSought for comment, Dubai Chambers Vice President for International Relations Sector Salem Al Shamsi expressed optimism regarding the anticipated signing of CEPA with the Philippines next month.\n“This is a promising information, because for us there’s a lot of opportunities for the bilateral trade to be increased both ways, from the Philippines to Dubai, and from Dubai to the Philippines,” said Al Shamsi.

world-bank-group-to-lend-philippines-22-23-billion-from-mid-2025-to-2031	World Bank Group to lend Philippines $22-23 billion from mid-2025 to 2031	The World Bank Group (WBG) will extend to the Philippines between $22 billion and $23 billion—or as much as over ₱1.2 trillion—in loan and other financing starting mid-2025 until 2031 to support both public and private initiatives aligned with the country's climb to upper-middle-income country (UMIC) status.\nAccording to the country partnership framework (CPF) for the Philippines covering the period July 2025 to June 2031—coinciding with the Washington-based multilateral lender's fiscal years 2026 to 2031—the new six-year lending program would allow the WBG "to provide continued support for the government's implementation of the current PDP," referring to the Philippine Development Plan 2023-2028, which serves as the socioeconomic blueprint of the Marcos Jr. administration.\nIn particular, during FYs 2026 to 2031, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), which is the WBG's lending arm for developing countries like the Philippines, will lend about $18 billion, or $3 billion per year, according to the document seen by Manila Bulletin.\nThe WBG noted that its IBRD portfolio in the Philippines has ballooned from only $377.6 million in new annual commitments during FY 2018 to $2.85 billion in the current FY 2025, ending next month. The average financing size per lending operation, or the usual amount of a loan, likewise more than doubled—from $189 million to as much as $458 million this year.\nUnder IBRD financing, "successful investment projects will be scaled up through additional financing or follow-on operations."\n"New instruments—such as program-for-results (PforR) and multiphase programmatic approach (MPA) programs—will be introduced to expand the range of tools available to better support the Philippines," the document read.\n"Trust funds will continue to play a catalytic role, with an expected recipient-executed grant volume of $150-200 million, alongside $20-30 million of bank-executed trust funds," it added.\nThe rest of the indicative WBG financing for the next six years will be through its private-sector lending arm, the International Finance Corp. (IFC), with an estimated $4-5 billion in long-term commitments and mobilization.\nWith a cumulative $1.9 billion in commitments from 2018 to 2025, "going forward, the IFC will continue building its program around eight priority areas with climate and digitalization as cross-cutting themes," the WBG said.\n"The IFC aims to ramp up its new commitments from around $400-600 million per year in earlier years of the CPF to around $1 billion in [the] second half," the document added.\nThe IFC also plans to convert about $29.6 million worth in its advisory portfolio in the Philippines into potential investments, specifically in the areas of affordable and resilient housing, capital market development, climate finance, digitalization, financial inclusion, green and resilient buildings and cities, private-sector investment promotion and reforms, as well as public-private partnerships (PPPs).\nAs the WBG mentioned in its May 22 statement following the endorsement of this new CPF by its board of executive directors, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), which extends political risk insurance to both private-sector investors and lenders, is "exploring opportunities to support domestic and cross-border investment through its different products, including LCMF [local currency mobilization facility], trade finance and non-honoring guarantees."\n"The deployment of guarantees, however, will depend on investor demand and pace of project development," it added, citing that MIGA "currently has no active guarantees in the Philippines due to perceived low political risk, but it remains engaged with potential investors to mobilize foreign capital."\nMIGA is looking into collaborating with the WBG and the IFC in Philippine renewable energy (RE), wherein "there is considerable foreign investor interest," as well as microgrid projects in remote areas, data center development, and transport infrastructure to be rolled out through PPPs.\nAccording to the WBG, the 2026-2031 CPF's alignment with PDP 2023-2028 means that its financing for the Philippines will focus on the following three outcome areas and indicators: improved access to quality health and education; more private-sector jobs; and stronger socioeconomic resilience, to be cross-cut by its aim of making the government more efficient.\nIn particular, the new CPF targets 19 million Filipinos receiving quality health, nutrition, and population services; 15 million students supported with better education; four million new or better jobs; 19 million people using broadband internet; $2 billion in total private capital enabled or mobilized; 12.5 million beneficiaries of social safety net programs; 13 million people with enhanced resilience to climate risks; as well as 20 million Filipinos using digitally enabled services under an efficient public sector, the document said.\n"The CPF aligns with the country’s goal of achieving UMIC status and its long-term vision, AmBisyon Natin 2040, which envisions a prosperous and inclusive society," the WBG said.\nIt cited that "the Philippines is on the verge of achieving UMIC status, following 15 years of strong, job-rich, and pro-poor growth."\nHowever, despite robust economic growth in recent years, "socio-economic indicators surpass LMIC [lower-middle-income country] averages but fall short of UMIC standards," the WBG lamented, noting that the Philippines' gross national income (GNI) per capita stood at only half of UMICs' average.\nAlso, "education and health indicators also lag behind UMIC levels," such that "low educational outcomes and nutritional deficiencies hinder human capital, exacerbated by the [Covid-19] pandemic," it said.\n"As it transitions to UMIC status, the country faces challenges in sustaining growth, reducing poverty, and expanding its middle class. While the economic outlook remains positive, potential GDP [gross domestic product] growth is projected to slow by one percentage point over the next two decades due to current trends in capital accumulation and productivity growth," the WBG said.\nOnce the Philippines achieves UMIC status, it will eventually lose access to the relatively lower interest rates attached to official development assistance (ODA), or cheap loans extended by multilateral lenders like the World Bank, the Manila-based Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), as well as its bilateral development partners such as Japan and South Korea, among others.

sec-approves-ayalas-20-billion-offering-of-preferred-shares	SEC approves Ayala's ₱20 billion offering of preferred shares	The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved the planned ₱20 billion offering of re-issued preferred shares by Zobel-led Ayala Corporation.\nIn its meeting on May 27, the Commission En Banc resolved to render effective the registration statement of Ayala covering the re-issuance of five million preferred B shares, with an overallotment option of up to five million shares, subject to the company’s compliance with certain remaining requirements.\nAyala will offer the preferred shares at P2,000 apiece. Assuming the overallotment option is fully subscribed, the listed conglomerate could net up to P19.86 billion from the offer.\nProceeds of the offering will be used to repay its short-term bank loans as well as for general corporate purposes and capital expenditures.\nThe offer shares are expected to be re-issued and listed on the Main Board of the Philippine Stock Exchange on June 18, according to the latest timeline submitted to the SEC. Trading is expected to start on the same date.\nAyala has tapped BPI Capital Corporation, BDO Capital Corporation, Chinabank Capital Corporation, First Metro Investment Corporation, PNB Capital and Investment Corporation, RCBC Capital Corporation and Security Bank Capital Investment Corporation as joint lead underwriters and bookrunners for the offer.\nThe conglomerate recently reported that its smaller and newer businesses have turned around or are reducing losses amid measures being taken to ensure their profitability in about two years.\n“Our smaller, newer companies are turning the corner. We are constructive on the year,” Ayala President and CEO Cezar P. Consing said.\nFor the first quarter of 2025, AC Health narrowed net losses to ₱59 million from ₱191 million in the same period last year, driven by better utilization of facilities and improved margins through prudent cost management, supported by the absence of KonsultaMD losses.\nThe improved performance was anchored by stronger results from the provider group, which more than offset softness in the pharma segment.\nAC Logistics’ core net loss narrowed to ₱303 million from ₱400 million on the back of cost savings and margin uplift from the closures of Entrego and the last mile arm of AIR21.\nSimilarly, attributable EBIT losses narrowed to ₱153 million from ₱229 million as rationalization initiatives reduced OPEX by ₱500 million.\nAC Industrials saw its core net loss narrow to ₱115 million from ₱331 million. Including one-offs, reported net loss narrowed to ₱294 million from ₱932 million.\nIMI’s continued turnaround and reduced stake in Merlin Solar more than offset wider losses in ACMobility.\nIMI reported a net income of US$3.3 million, a turnaround from the US$3.7 million net loss last year on the back of improved margins and cost savings from the restructuring activities.\nACMobility posted a net loss of ₱168 million from ₱35 million due to marketing and manpower expenses, mainly related to the ramp-up of BYD and its charging infrastructure network.\nAyala Corporation Chairman Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala said last month that, “We want to ensure that our emerging business units have a credible path to scale and the ability to achieve good valuation levels. Currently, we're focused on helping our emerging businesses achieve profitability and scale.”	"\\tImages/sec-approves-ayalas-20-billion-offering-of-preferred-shares_1.png"	The SEC approved Ayala Corporation's ₱20 billion preferred shares offering.  Ayala will use the proceeds to repay loans and for general corporate purposes.  The offering involves five million preferred B shares, with an overallotment option of up to five million more.

inflation-news-fails-to-move-psei-needle	Inflation news fails to move PSEi needle	The Philippine Stock Exchange index (PSEi) ended the day almost flat despite the announcement of a low inflation rate for May, as this was already expected and priced in by the market.\nThe main index shed 1.77 points or 0.03 percent to close at 6,376.79, although only Banks declined, while the Property sector led advancers. Volume was relatively stable at 912 million shares worth P6.31 billion as losers edged out gainers 101 to 100, with 48 unchanged.\n“Philippine and US equities delivered a mixed performance, weighed down by the weakest private sector hiring in two years, tepid payroll gains, and a slipping dollar, all fueling investor caution,” said Regina Capital Development Corporation Managing Director Luis Limlingan.\nHe added that, “Meanwhile, price action was fairly muted given the CPI came in within many analysts' expectations. The May CPI print came at 1.3 percent, which was a slight improvement from the 1.4 percent in April.”\nPhilstocks Financial Research Manager Japhet Tantiangco said “the PSEi's sideways movement closed in the negative territory. The market's marginal decline is attributed mainly to the selling of index heavyweights such as SM, MER, and BDO.”	"\\tImages/inflation-news-fails-to-move-psei-needle_1.png"	The Philippine Stock Exchange index (PSEi) remained almost unchanged despite May's low inflation rate, which was already anticipated.  The index slightly decreased, with only the Banks sector declining and Property leading gains.  Selling of major companies like SM, MER, and BDO contributed to the marginal decline.

local-stocks-expected-to-remain-range-bound-amid-waning-momentum	Local stocks expected to remain range-bound amid waning momentum	The Philippine stock market is expected to continue moving sideways this week after benign inflation failed to spur a rally, although some investors will take cues from data to be released by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, including foreign direct investment and balance of payment numbers.\n“(Last week), the PSEi moved sideways as buying momentum wanes despite stable inflation. Continue to expect the market to move sideways to down within the 6,000 to 6,500 levels in the near term,” said Reyes Tacandong & Co. Senior Adviser Jonathan Ravelas.\nPhilstocks Financial Research Manager Japhet Tantiangco noted that the PSEi failed to breach the 6,400 resistance line last week and trading has been lethargic, thus, “Overall, market confidence is seen to remain low which explains the tepid movements.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhile the local market is deemed undervalued with a price-to-earnings ration of 11.5 times compared to its five-year average of 17.3 times and the regional average of 15.9 times, he said “Sentiment remains bearish however due to the lingering global trade uncertainties caused by the US’ trade policies.”\n“On a positive note, our latest inflation print may raise hopes of more aggressive policy easing by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas which in turn may give the market a boost.\n“Next week, investors are also expected to digest our labor market data as this would give clues on the strength of our local economy,” Tantiangco said.\nOnline brokerage firm 2TradeAsia.com said “the country continues to enjoy disinflation, unlike peers in the region… This development supports a more accommodative monetary policy stance by the BSP-recall that the BSP already did a second quarter cut (25bps), with consensus leaning towards an early third quarter cut.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Our view is leaning towards a conservative June or August cut (versus June and August) given long-run pressure from fiscal restart and pending wage increases.”\nFor stock picks, Abacus Securities Corporation names three companies that are optimal for one to two years that also gives out dividends regularly: PLDT, RL Commercial REIT, and Citicore Renewable Energy Corporation.\n“We like TEL because buzz about Maya's IPO will grow over the given time frame but especially after rival Mynt goes public. We also recommend RCR because management indicated plans that would increase its market capitalization by 200 percent via asset infusions and this is likely to qualify it for index inclusion as soon as next year.\n“Lastly, CREC will likely have completed 1.0 to 1.5 gigawatts (gross) of solar capacity by end-2026 compared to a few hundred megawatts currently. And, like other solar power firms, it is benefitting significantly from a supportive regulatory environment and falling costs for photovoltaic panels and batteries,” the stock brokerage said.	"\\tImages/local-stocks-expected-to-remain-range-bound-amid-waning-momentum_1.png"	Philippine stocks are expected to remain sideways this week due to waning momentum despite stable inflation.  The PSEi failed to break the 6,400 resistance, indicating low market confidence.  While undervalued compared to regional averages, bearish sentiment persists due to global trade uncertainties.  However, lower inflation may lead to policy easing, potentially boosting the market.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/09/local-stocks-expected-to-remain-range-bound-amid-waning-momentum

makati-court-affirms-guilty-verdict-for-calata-execs-in-market-manipulation-case	Makati court affirms guilty verdict for Calata execs in market manipulation case	The Makati City Regional Trial Court has upheld the conviction of the officers of the delisted Calata Corporation for making misleading statements about its supposed Mactan Leisure City project, which led to a surge in the trading of its shares in 2016.\nIn a consolidated order dated May 19, Branch 148 of the Regional Trial Court of Makati City denied the motion for reconsideration filed by the officers of Calata Corporation, seeking their acquittal on two counts of violating Section 24(d) of the Securities Regulation Code (SRC).\nThe court, in its decision on May 31, 2024, sentenced Joseph H. Calata, chairman, president, and chief executive officer of the company, and Jose Marie Fabella, corporate secretary, compliance officer and corporate information officer, to pay fines of ₱4 million each, or to serve prison time if they fail to pay on account of insolvency, for market manipulation.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSection 24(d) of the SRC prohibits the making of false or misleading statements on any material, which a person knew or had reasonable ground to believe was false or deceptive, to induce investors to buy a security listed or traded on an exchange.\nIn the order, the court denied the Calata officers’ claim that they did not violate Section 24(d) of the SRC, instead finding that they violated Section 17 of the same law, which pertains to reportorial requirements and is merely administrative in nature, without involving penal sanctions.\n“The fact that [Calata and Fabella] may have also committed an administrative violation of Section 17 of the SRC is not a bar to prosecution under Section 24 of the [SRC],” the court held, noting that the imposition of administrative sanctions does not preclude the filing of criminal charges.\nIt also rejected the claim of Calata Corporation’s officers that there was insufficient evidence to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt, given the lack of actual injuries and witnesses testifying that they suffered losses from the alleged misleading disclosures.\n“Actual loss or harm, much less actual public harm, is not an element of the offense. Thus, the Court reiterates that the evidence presented by the prosecution proves beyond reasonable doubt the criminal liability of the accused,” the court ruled.\nThe decisions stemmed from a case buildup led by the SEC due to the surge in the trading volume of Calata’s shares, following its disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange on August 23, 2016 referring to its partnership with Sino-America Gaming and Macau Resources Group Limited for the development of a $1.4 billion integrated resort and casino project called Mactan Leisure City.\nIn the disclosure, the company claimed the project was expected to start operations in 2020, with projected gross annual revenues of ₱55.74 billion. This resulted in a surge in the trading volume of its shares by 2,455 percent on the same day, followed by a 196.41 percent increase in the next trading day.\nThe court ruled that the disclosures contained “unfounded promises and exaggerations,” and such information was disclosed despite the absence of a license application with the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) for the project.\nThe company’s August 26, 2016 disclosure clarifying the partnership agreements for the project was likewise found to be misleading, as it did not provide whether an application for an integrated casino permit had already been submitted to PAGCOR.\nEight shareholders of Calata Corporation were also previously indicted for market manipulation for employing manipulative devices that induced the public to buy their shares.\nADVERTISEMENT	"\\tImages/makati-court-affirms-guilty-verdict-for-calata-execs-in-market-manipulation-case_1.png"	A Makati court affirmed the guilty verdict against Calata Corporation executives for market manipulation.  Joseph Calata and Jose Marie Fabella were fined ₱4 million each or face prison time.  The court found their statements about the Mactan Leisure City project misleading, causing a surge in share trading.  The decision followed a case built by the SEC due to the significant increase in Calata's share trading volume.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/09/makati-court-affirms-guilty-verdict-for-calata-execs-in-market-manipulation-case

maynilads-pipeline-overhaul-aims-for-major-water-loss-reduction-this-year	Maynilad's pipeline overhaul aims for major water loss reduction this year	Maynilad Water Services, Inc. has replaced over 3,293 kilometers of old and aging pipelines in its concession area since 2006 as part of its long-term Non-Revenue Water (NRW) management program to address physical water losses.\nIn a statement, Maynilad said the extensive pipe replacement effort, which is roughly equivalent to the distance between Manila and Tokyo, helped address physical water losses caused by leaks and bursts in older sections of the distribution network—a key challenge in the densely populated and coastal areas served by the concessionaire. \nAs of the end of 2024, physical losses, such as pipe leaks, accounted for 90 percent of total NRW, while commercial losses, such as illegal connections, comprised 10 percent, consistent with disclosures in the company’s approved Business Plan.\nRyan Jamora, Maynilad central NRW head, said that their “NRW reduction program is a sustained, multi-year commitment.”\n He added that “replacing aging pipelines is a critical part of this strategy, as it not only reduces water losses but also improves pressure and reliability for our customers.”\nUnder its MWSS-approved 2023–2027 Business Plan, Maynilad continues to implement targeted pipe replacement projects in priority zones, in close coordination with local government units (LGUs) and other stakeholders.\nJamora noted that they “are working toward our target of reducing NRW to 34 percent this year—a substantial improvement from the 66 percent NRW level prior to Maynilad’s re-privatization in 2007.” \nHe added that “it is a challenging goal, but we are leveraging advanced technologies and the expertise of our skilled teams to sustain water loss recovery across our network.”\nMaynilad is the largest private water concessionaire of Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) in the country in terms of customer base. \nIts service area includes the cities of Manila (all but portions of San Andres and Sta. Ana), Quezon City (west of San Juan River, West Avenue, EDSA, Congressional, Mindanao Avenue, the northern part starting from the Districts of Holy Spirit and Batasan Hills), Makati (west of South Super Highway).\nMaynilad also covers Caloocan, Pasay, Parañaque, Las Piñas, Muntinlupa, Valenzuela, Navotas, and Malabon, all in Metro Manila; and the cities of Cavite, Bacoor, and Imus, and the municipalities of Kawit, Noveleta, and and Rosario, all in the province of Cavite.

govt-partners-with-dongguan-business-chamber-to-attract-chinese-investments	Gov't partners with Dongguan business chamber to attract Chinese investments	The Philippine government has named the leading business chamber of Dongguan, China, as its newest investment promotion partner, signaling strengthened economic integration between the two countries.\nIn a statement, the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) said its top official, Director General Tereso Panga, has signed a memorandum of understanding with the China Chamber of International Commerce (CCOIC) - Dongguan, headed by Zhao Wenfa.\nThe new partnership is an outcome of PEZA’s investment mission to China last March, during which the China+1+1 strategy was cited as a key opportunity for the Philippines.\nSeen as an upgrade to the China+1 scheme, China+1+1 is a rising trend where companies maintain their operations in China while expanding to other Asian markets.\nPEZA said talks of this strategy laid the groundwork for closer collaboration with Chinese companies looking for a resilient, dual-base production and supply chain model in the region.\nThe investment promotion agency (IPA) said CCOIC’s Zhao has committed to leveraging its business operations as a foundation for the economic collaboration.\nAside from his position at the business group, Zhao is also the chief executive officer (CEO) of Dongguan Aoxing Audio Visual Equipment Co. Ltd., a manufacturing firm that produces equipment for brands such as HP, Epson, and Skyworth.\nWith his business insight and experience in Chinese business communities, PEZA said Zhao is well-positioned to lead efforts to promote both local and foreign direct investments (FDI) into PEZA ecozones.\n“PEZA counts the Chinese investors, including those from Taiwan and Hong Kong, among our best bets for FDI attraction for this year and for succeeding years to come,” said Panga.\nWith the Philippines being considered as the new “plus one” destination for Chinese companies, investment promotion partners such as Zhao’s CCOIC - Dongguan plays a vital role in engaging with potential investors.\nPanga said this will ultimately promote the Philippines’ “competitive edge as the emerging investment hub in the region.”\nThe PEZA chief earlier said that capturing the interest of Chinese companies could help the country weather the storm from the impact of the reimplementation of the United States’ (US) reciprocal tariffs.\nThe agency’s data showed that South Korea is the leading source of investment commitments this year, accounting for 16.12 percent of the total approved investments.\nOther major sources of investment include the US, China, Japan, and the Netherlands.\nFor the first five months of the year, PEZA said it has approved ₱66.34 billion in investment pledges, up 80 percent from the ₱36.83 billion recorded in the same period last year.	"\\tImages/govt-partners-with-dongguan-business-chamber-to-attract-chinese-investments_1.png"	The Philippine government partnered with Dongguan's business chamber to attract Chinese investments, strengthening economic ties.  This follows a PEZA investment mission to China highlighting the China+1+1 strategy.  The partnership aims to leverage Chinese companies seeking dual-base production and supply chains.

govt-borrows-above-target-286-billion-amid-continued-decline-in-interest-costs	Gov't borrows above-target ₱28.6 billion amid continued decline in interest costs	The government has once again exceeded its ₱25-billion borrowing target, raising ₱28.6 billion from short-term debt papers, as cooling inflation and growing expectations of a Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) rate cut sustained investor demand and pushed yields lower across all tenors.\nAt the latest treasury bills (T-bills) auction on Monday, June 9, the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) awarded more than its planned fund-raising, with total bids reaching ₱98 billion—nearly four times the amount of debt paper it offered.\nThis week’s total bids were slightly lower than the ₱116.3 billion in tenders from the previous T-bill auction on June 2.\nThe government fully awarded the ₱8-billion offering for 91-day T-bills. Total tenders reached ₱20.2 billion. The average rate was 5.451 percent, slightly lower than the previous week’s 5.452-percent rate.\nFor 182-day debt papers, the BTr also raised ₱8 billion, fully awarding the offered amount. Bids reached ₱38.6 billion. It fetched an average rate of 5.524 percent, lower by 4.1 basis points (bps) than last week’s 5.565 percent.\nNotably, the BTr borrowed more than the planned ₱9 billion through 364-day IOUs, raising ₱12.6 billion. Demand reached ₱39.4 billion. Similarly, the average rate dropped slightly by 2.4 bps to 5.656 percent from 5.68 percent in the previous auction.\nPrior to Monday’s auction, PHP Bloomberg Valuation (PHP BVAL) Reference Rates showed that the 91-, 182-, and 364-day T-bills were quoted at 5.441 percent, 5.61 percent, and 5.681 percent, respectively. Benchmark rates for both the three-month and six-month debt papers inched up slightly from the previous week, but the one-year securities went down.\nThe average rate for three-month T-bills clocked in lower than the key borrowing costs of 5.5 percent. Meanwhile, longer-dated IOUs stood higher than the benchmark.\nAccording to Michael Ricafort, chief economist at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. (RCBC), the continued decline in T-bill interest rates followed a further drop in inflation to a new 5.5-year low of 1.3 percent in May.\nHe said this development may pave the way for another quarter-point rate cut by the BSP in its upcoming June 19 policy meeting.\nConsequently, some investors are securing higher T-bill yields before potential declines in both BSP rates and T-bill yields, the economist added.

govt-invests-13-billion-in-biometric-e-gates-to-strengthen-border-control	Gov't invests ₱1.3 billion in biometric e-gates to strengthen border control	The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) has released a total of ₱1.3 billion to support the ongoing implementation of the Electronic Gates (E-gates) Project in major international gateways across the country.\n“The DBM already released the budget allocation for the E-gates Project for 2025, amounting to ₱1.347 billion,” Budget Secretary Amenah F. Pangandaman said in a statement released on Tuesday, June 10.\nAs per the DBM, the project “modernizes and digitizes the primary inspection process at the country’s international gateways to further strengthen national security, improve efficiency, and elevate the overall experience of passengers while addressing issues of immigration congestion.”\nE-gates are automated passport control systems that use biometric technology, such as facial recognition or fingerprint scanning, to verify the identity of travelers.\nAccording to Pangandaman, this action was in line with the President’s “directive of providing convenience to travelers, whether locals or foreign visitors, and reducing long queues at immigration counters.”\nPangandaman said that last year, the DBM was able to release ₱2 billion to the Bureau of Immigration (BI) for the procurement of equipment for Phase 1 of the project..\n“This will continue until Phase 3 in 2026. This year, we are already in Phase 2, and we are appealing to the BI to expedite the procurement process so that the E-gates Project can become fully operational as soon as possible,” Pangandaman further said.\n“Several existing e-gates were installed at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) and will be expanded to other premier international gateways in the country,” the agency said.\nIt added that the expansion of the project would improve the “efficiency of security and immigration processes by catering to arriving and departing passengers, regardless of their citizenship.”\nAlso, the project is expected to automate half of all manned inspection counters using modern technology.\nBased on the project's modernization plan, e-gates will be installed in key airports and one seaport across the country, with funding allocated accordingly. These include NAIA Terminals I and III, Clark International Airport, Mactan Cebu International Airport, Davao International Airport, Kalibo International Airport, Boracay-Caticlan International Airport, Zamboanga International Seaport, Laoag International Airport, Bohol-Panglao International Airport, and Puerto Princesa International Airport.\nThe target date for the full implementation of operational e-gates is on or before Dec. 15, 2025.

govt-absorbs-higher-yields-to-fully-award-30-billion-ious	Gov't absorbs higher yields to fully award ₱30-billion IOUs	Despite lower demand from local investors, the Marcos administration has successfully borrowed its planned ₱30 billion through the sale of long-term debt securities at higher interest rates, amid reduced chances of US Federal Reserve rate cuts.\nAt an auction on Tuesday, June 10, the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) awarded the offered amount through the sale of five-year Treasury bonds (T-bonds). Bids totaled ₱57.7 billion, nearly twice the amount offered.\nHowever, demand was weaker than the ₱71.7 billion in tenders from the same auction on May 6.\nWith a remaining life of seven years and three months, the bonds were awarded at an average rate of 6.124 percent. This was 4.3 basis points (bps) higher than the previous auction’s 6.081 percent.\nThis was 5.2 bps higher than the 6.072-percent rate for comparable corporate bonds in the secondary market, based on the PHP Bloomberg Valuation (BVAL) Service Reference Rate.\nRizal Commercial Banking Corp. (RCBC) Chief Economist Michael L. Ricafort said higher interest costs followed recent record highs in national government yields and increased US Treasury yields.\nThey inched higher amid reduced chances of US Federal Reserve rate cuts, following recent progress in US-China trade talks, stronger-than-expected US employment data, and global oil prices climbing to two-month highs.\nThe Philippines borrows more locally, through treasury bills and bonds, than from foreign sources. This borrowing strategy leverages domestic banks and creditors who are flush with cash, while mitigating exposure to foreign exchange (forex) risks and volatility.\nThe government’s outstanding debt was equivalent to 62 percent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter, its highest level in two years. It climbed from 60.7 percent at the end of 2024.\nSpecifically, domestic debt stood at 42.3 percent of GDP, while foreign debt had a GDP ratio of 19.7 percent.

mining-groups-applaud-removal-of-ore-export-ban-from-fiscal-reform-bill	Mining groups applaud removal of ore export ban from fiscal reform bill	The country’s leading mining groups welcomed the bicameral conference committee’s decision to remove the highly contentious ore export ban from the reconciled version of the bill seeking to reform the mining fiscal regime.\nIn separate statements on Wednesday, June 11, the Chamber of Mines of the Philippines (COMP) and the Philippine Nickel Industry Association (PNIA) threw their support behind the proposed Enhanced Fiscal Regime for Large-Scale Metallic Mining Act.\nThe measure, deemed a priority of the Marcos administration under the Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council (LEDAC), seeks to establish a more equitable fiscal framework for large-scale mining operations in the country.\nSpecifically, it proposes a five-tier margin-based royalty system and a windfall profit system for the mining industry as a boon for the development of local industries.\nOne provision that drew strong criticism from mining groups is the proposed implementation of a ban on exporting locally extracted raw minerals. \nThe ban, which was introduced in the measure’s Senate version, was supposed to take effect five years after the bill’s enactment. The minerals being considered for an export ban include gold, copper, iron, and nickel.\nAccording to the World Trade Organization (WTO), even Japan and the United Kingdom (UK) expressed their concerns over this provision during an April meeting of the Council for Trade in Goods’ (CTG).\nWith the removal of this provision, the PNIA said this reflects a stronger understanding on the part of legislators of the challenges surrounding domestic mineral processing.\nPNIA, the country’s largest group of nickel mining companies, said this makes the bill more prudent and forward-looking in protecting jobs and upholding investor confidence.\n“We thank our policymakers for considering the concerns raised by various stakeholders and for choosing a path that safeguards economic stability while keeping the door open for long-term industrial development,” it said.\nWith the Philippines being the world's second-largest supplier of nickel ore, the group stated that the bill’s proposed fiscal reforms accurately reflect its actual business performance, while also aligning with international best practices.\n“Fiscal predictability and economic rationality are essential to attract long-term investments and enable the growth of a competitive, responsible mining industry,” said PNIA.\nCOMP, for its part, said the reconciled measure’s shift to a tax regime based on profit margins and windfall earnings would allow the government to benefit more when global commodity prices rise.\nThis is without placing undue burden on miners during market downturns, it said.\n“This framework offers a win-win outcome: it ensures fairer and more sustainable government revenues, encourages both local and foreign investment, and strengthens the Philippines’ role in the global clean energy supply chain,” said COMP.\nFollowing the approval of the report reconciling the differing provisions of the bill in the bicameral conference committee, the bill needs to be ratified in the Senate and the House of Representatives. After this, the bill will then be transmitted to Malacañang for the president’s signature.\nWith the measure’s near enactment, PNIA is urging the government to address issues that continue to plague the local mining industry.\nThe group said persistent problems such as high energy costs, weak infrastructure, policy uncertainty, and permitting delays should be addressed to build a robust value-added processing sector in the country.\nThese issues, according to PNIA, “continue to deter large-scale investments in mineral processing.”	"\\tImages/mining-groups-applaud-removal-of-ore-export-ban-from-fiscal-reform-bill_1.png"	Philippine mining groups celebrated the removal of an ore export ban from a fiscal reform bill.  The ban, initially proposed for gold, copper, iron, and nickel, drew criticism internationally.

government-set-to-sign-1-billion-world-bank-agri-loan-next-month	Government set to sign $1-billion World Bank agri loan next month	The Philippines is set to sign a record-high $1-billion loan agreement, or about ₱55.8 billion, from the World Bank to provide budgetary support for the country’s major infrastructure projects aimed at boosting the agriculture sector.\nAccording to the World Bank’s website, the funding support will be directed to the Philippine Sustainable Agricultural Transformation (PSAT) program, under the Department of Agriculture (DA).\nA document published on the World Bank’s website indicated that PSAT is projected to cost $20 billion (over ₱1.1 trillion), of which the Philippine government would shoulder the $11.9 billion (over ₱683 billion) out of the $12.8975 billion (over ₱741 billion) operation cost. With the $1-billion funding, there would be a financing gap of $2.5 million.\nWorld Bank Agriculture and Food Global Director Shobha Shetty said the new loan to the Philippines would be unlike previous agreements, as it would be the country’s first project under the Program-for-Results (PforR) financing framework.\n“So essentially, the $1 billion supports the budget of the [DA] and the way we disburse the money is based on achievement of certain results,” Shetty said in a recent media briefing.\nSince the agreement has not yet been signed, Shetty did not disclose the disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs) for the loan agreement.\nHowever, based on a document published on the World Bank’s website, DLIs are described as specific, measurable, and verifiable indicators related to loan program development objectives and results framework.\nThese indicators could be in the form of outcomes, outputs, intermediate outcomes or outputs, process indicators, or financing indicators.\nThe Washington-based multilateral lender disclosed that the loan is scheduled for approval on June 27, as of the latest board presentation.\nShetty said that on the part of the World Bank, “everything is ready”.\n“I think a lot of it is also going to depend on the internal processes of the Philippine government…We are now just waiting for the government of the Philippines to go through its usual approval processes,” she added.\nThe Department of Finance (DOF), the agency responsible for the financial resources of the government, shall borrow on behalf of the DA—the project’s implementing agency.\nPSAT, which will be implemented from 2025 to 2029, is scheduled to launch in August.\nOn the part of the government, DA Assistant Secretary Arnel de Mesa said it is eyeing to sign the loan agreement for the project in July.\nDe Mesa said the proposed loan was only recently given the greenlight by the Executive Technical Board (ETB) of the Development Budget Coordination Committee (DBCC).\nThe ETB serves as the clearinghouse of the DBCC, comprising undersecretaries and directors from the committee’s member agencies.\nDe Mesa, also the DA’s spokesperson, noted that as a budgetary support to the DA, the loan will be coursed through the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr).\nThe fiscal support, he said, will help the agency fund its priority infrastructure projects to promote sustainable agriculture and strengthen the government’s food security agenda.\nThe official noted that this will cover irrigation projects, food hubs, greenhouse facilities, cold storages, and drip irrigation systems, among others.\nAccording to the World Bank, the PSAT is envisioned by the Philippine government to significantly improve productivity, diversification, climate resilience, and public resource use efficiency of the country's agri-food systems.

upcoming-600-million-world-bank-loan-to-help-upskill-filipino-workers	Upcoming $600-million World Bank loan to help upskill Filipino workers	A $600-million (over ₱33-billion) loan scheduled to be greenlit by the Washington-based World Bank in December is aiming to not only help sustain robust economic expansion in the Philippines but also ensure that Filipino workers are ready to reap growth-induced employment.\nIn a June 2 program information document (PID), the World Bank said its forthcoming Philippines growth and jobs development policy loan (DPL) is expected to be approved by its board on Dec. 11, 2025.\nThe Department of Finance (DOF) will borrow on behalf of the Philippine government for this loan, which will be jointly implemented by the following agencies: Department of Education (DepEd), Board of Investments (BOI), Anti-Red Tape Authority (ARTA), Early Childhood Care and Development Council (ECCDC), Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), Department of Economy, Planning, and Development (DEPDev), Department of Budget and Management (DBM), Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA), National Innovation Council (NIC), National Tax Research Center (NTRC), and Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB).\n"The DPL series aims to support the government of the Philippines strengthen fiscal management, enhance business opportunities, and build labor force capabilities," the World Bank said.\nSpecifically, the loan will partly focus on reforms that aim to boost tax revenues as a share of gross domestic product (GDP), increase the number of local government units (LGUs) with updated real property valuations, as well as shorten the time and cost for national government agencies (NGAs) to procure goods and services, the document said.\nThe loan also targets reforms to raise the ratio of shares traded relative to domestic market capitalization, increase the value of tax-deductible expenditures, as well as shorten the registration and permitting process for foreign firms, it added.\nAdditionally, the upcoming World Bank financing seeks to expand the share of technical-vocational education and training (TVET) graduates with enterprise-based training, enhance student performance in reading and literacy, as well as increase the number of early-career workers—especially newly certified women—holding National Certificate 3 qualifications.\nAs Manila Bulletin reported earlier, the Philippines will borrow a total of $7.85 billion, or over ₱437 billion, from the World Bank in the next two years under their new six-year Country Partnership Framework (CPF) or lending program supportive of the country's climb to upper-middle-income country (UMIC) status.\nThe World Bank Group (WBG) plans to extend to the Philippines between $22 billion and $23 billion—or as much as over ₱1.2 trillion—in loans and other financing starting mid-2025 until mid-2031, covering fiscal years (FYs) 2026 to 2031.\nFor the remainder of the current FY 2025 ending this month, the World Bank still has three Philippine loans to approve: the $4-million Roads to Development, scheduled for board approval on June 16; the biggest-ever single loan amounting to $1 billion for the Philippines Sustainable Agriculture Transformation Program on June 27; as well as $240.6-million Accelerated Water and Sanitation Project in Selected Areas, also on June 27.\nThe first two loans scheduled for approval in the next FY 2026, which starts in July 2025, include the $700-million Philippines Community Resilience Project-Pagkilos on July 28, and $600-million Project for Learning Upgrade Support and Decentralization (PLUS-D) on Sept. 26 this year.

This brings to the fore the current buzz I hear along the banking corridors: the new management of Philippine Veterans Bank is keenly eyeing to purchase UCPB Savings Bank Inc.\nThe buy-out will be undertaken through a negotiated sale by RYM Business Management Corp., owned by the family of House Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez, which acquired a 49 percent interest in Veterans Bank in 2023.\nA wholly-owned subsidiary of Land Bank of the Philippines, UCPB Savings has been on the auction block following the President's approval of its privatization in August last year. In March 2022, Land Bank inherited UCPB Savings after its merger with the mother bank, United Coconut Planters Bank.\nThe sale of UCPB Savings will not only provide one-time incremental revenue for Land Bank, estimated at ₱2.4 billion, but will also notably lessen its management responsibility because it likewise owns the Overseas Filipino Bank (OFBank).\nThe only state-owned digital bank, OFBank used to be the Philippine Postal Savings Bank and caters to the financial needs of our unsung heroes – the overseas Filipino workers.\n“It’s a bit redundant” to own and manage both OFBank and UCPB Savings, explained a muted source familiar with the disposition.\nDespite its positive performance and the inherent attraction of having 49 branches with 10 branch-lite units and four lending offices, Land Bank suffered two failed attempts to dispose of UCPB Savings. As a result, the disposition will now go through the negotiated route, as allowed under procurement law.\nIt was said that the entry of RYM Business gave Veterans Bank fiscal strength. From what I’ve gathered, it also came with changes in the bank's top management, which are now peppered with former UCPB officials. Lest I be misconstrued here, I'm all for changes that bring in new ideas with an end in view of enhancing performance efficiency and customer service.\nIn broad strokes and all things considered, I can grasp the narrative behind the keen interest to acquire UCPB Savings, an institution that is so familiar to the new set of Veterans Bank top-tier officials.\nInterestingly, however, as I write this during the early morning of our Kalayaan Day, the bank’s website has yet to be updated, with Renato “Toto” A. Claravall still at the helm as president despite his “retirement” in the second half of 2024.\nMr. Toto has been replaced by Eulogio Catabran III, former UCPB executive vice president and head of treasury. Arturo Lipio is now the bank’s trust officer, with the “retirement” of Reevie Vergara.\nLeading corporate lawyer Carlos Ocampo, senior partner of Ocampo & Manalo Law firm, has been named vice chairman, replacing Guillermo “Com. Willy” Parayno, Jr., former Bureau of Customs Commissioner, who passed on two years ago. Former Finance Secretary Roberto F. de Ocampo remains the chairman. But like Mr. Toto, Com. Willy is still listed as the vice chair on the bank’s website.\nThe latest I heard is that Land Bank has already transmitted this to the Monetary Board, the policy-making body of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. Should the deal push through without hitches, I believe it's a no-brainer that the surviving entity would be Veterans Bank, the lender that is the envy of banking players because of its special privilege of being a government depository bank, as allowed in its amended charter.\nThe banking podium becomes provocatively interesting.\nTalkback to me at sionil731@gmail.com	"\\tImages/merger-in-the-offing_1.png"	Philippine Veterans Bank aims to acquire UCPB Savings Bank through a negotiated sale by RYM Business Management Corp.  UCPB Savings, a Land Bank subsidiary, is being privatized, offering Land Bank significant revenue and reduced management responsibilities.  The acquisition is driven by the familiarity of Veterans Bank's new management with UCPB Savings and Veterans Bank's enhanced fiscal strength.

soon-to-be-approved-world-bank-loan-to-improve-water-supply-and-sanitation-in-siargao-bohol-jolo	Soon-to-be-approved World Bank loan to improve water supply and sanitation in Siargao, Bohol, Jolo	A loan scheduled to be greenlit by the World Bank in October is aiming to improve water supply and sanitation in three Philippine islands.\nIn a June 5 project information document, the Washington-based multilateral lender said its upcoming $275.38-million—or over ₱15-billion—financing for the Philippines Accelerated Water and Sanitation Project in Selected Areas (AWSPSA) will be up for board approval on Oct. 31.\nThe World Bank will finance the bulk of the six-year project, whose total operation cost is $293.96 million, or more than ₱16 billion.\nAccording to World Bank documents, the Philippine government will shell out $14.16 million (over ₱780 million) to fill the project financing gap; private-sector equity will amount to $1.32 million; while an unguaranteed commercial debt of $3.08 million will also finance AWSPSA.\nThe Department of Finance (DOF) will borrow on behalf of the government.\nTo be jointly implemented by the departments of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) and of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), the project's goal is "to increase access to safely managed water supply and sanitation (WSS) services and improve the performance of water service providers in selected areas of the Philippines."\n"The Philippines exemplifies many of the [East Asia and the Pacific] region's water security challenges: 'too much, too little, too polluted,' with areas of high performance and others facing deep access and service gaps. As one of the fastest-growing emerging markets, the country faces significant population growth, urbanization, and industrialization, requiring substantial investments in WSS infrastructure," the World Bank said.\n"It is also one of the countries most impacted by water-related disasters and confronts the challenges of too much, too little, or too polluted water—all increasingly exacerbated by climate risks. These risks may worsen existing inequalities in infrastructure and quality and access gaps in WSS services," it added.\nThe World Bank lamented that as of 2022, only 48 percent of the Philippine population had access to safely managed water—far below the regional average of 78.4 percent, while safely managed sanitation covered 63 percent of the population, also lower than the region's 69 percent.\n"Only seven percent of households had sewer connections, while 70 percent relied on septic tanks which are often poorly constructed with unsealed bottoms, and outside Metro Manila, are not emptied regularly, preventing proper functioning. An estimated four million people, or three percent of the population, still practices open defecation, which is higher than the 1.1-percent regional average," the World Bank noted.\nIt did not help that "there are significant disparities in WSS coverage and quality between rich and poor populations, with basic WSS being the lowest in the country’s poorest communities," the World Bank said, citing that just 35 percent of rural areas had access to safe water in 2022, lower than the 62 percent among urban locations.\nTo support the government's aim to achieve universal access to safe WSS by 2030 under its 2020 Philippine water supply and sanitation master plan (PWSSMP), the World Bank said AWSPSA would "feature a sustainable approach to WSS projects that will help address gaps in institutions, regulation, and investments."\nThe specific WSS projects would be located in the following areas: Loboc, Bohol; Siargao Island, Surigao del Norte; and Jolo, Sulu.\n"The project is the first World Bank-financed WSS project in the Philippines in 20 years and is expected to serve as the basis for longer-term World Bank support to the sector," it said.\nAs Manila Bulletin reported earlier, the Philippines will borrow a total of $7.85 billion—or over ₱437 billion—from the World Bank in the next two years under their new six-year country partnership framework (CPF), or lending program supportive of the country's climb to upper-middle-income country (UMIC) status.\nThe World Bank Group (WBG) plans to extend to the Philippines between $22 billion and $23 billion—or as much as over ₱1.2 trillion—in loans and other financing starting mid-2025 until mid-2031, covering fiscal years (FYs) 2026 to 2031.

The six-year project aims to increase access to safely managed water and sanitation services.

upskilling-top-philippine-executives-part-2	Upskilling top Philippine executives part 2	Another upskilling program for Philippine management personnel, the Industrial Economics Program (IEP), was introduced by the Center for Research and Communication (CRC) in the late 1960s and early 1970s. When Dr. Jess Estanislao, Founder of CRC, left the Program Implementation Agency (PIA) under the Office of the President (then President Diosdado Macapagal), he transitioned to the private sector as a banker.\nHe quickly realized there was a scarcity of what we now call business economists or industrial economists. Even then, many courses at private colleges and universities, including the University of the Philippines, claimed to train economists. To his disappointment, however, there was a clear mismatch between the graduates of these economics programs and the demands of the real business world.\nAt that time, with the Philippine Government encouraging an import substitution approach to industrialization, potential investors were highly interested in the economics of various industries—for example, the economics of steel, pharmaceuticals, energy, food manufacturing, paper and pulp, cement, and chemicals. Industrial economists were needed not only for preparing feasibility studies but also for the actual operations of enterprises entering these new sectors. This required an optimal combination of expertise in macroeconomics (to understand the impact of monetary, fiscal, trade, and industrial policies on individual firms) and microeconomics (the economics of marketing, production, finance, and human resources). Even top universities like the University of the Philippines, the University of Santo Tomas, Ateneo, and De La Salle weren't producing professionals with the knowledge and skills for industrial economic research. At best, these universities graduated generalists steeped in economic theory but unable to apply their theoretical knowledge to actual industry or business research. They needed significant upskilling, not just in advanced economic theories but also in the tools of econometrics, research and statistical methods, and, considering business's responsibility to address unemployment and poverty, social economics.\nJess decided to gather a group of us from allied fields—economics, statistics, philosophy, and communications—to develop a program that would upskill, reskill, and retool college graduates from top universities across the Philippines. These trainees had diverse specializations, including electrical engineers, metallurgical engineers, economics and business administration majors, philosophers, and communications majors. Regardless of their college backgrounds, the first trainees in the Industrial Economics Program (IEP) had to develop expertise in economic theory, economic history, statistics and econometrics, research methods, social economics, and effective communication. For those who hadn't specialized in economics during their undergraduate years, we designed a Summer Qualifying Program (SQP) that provided them with a sufficient grounding in economic theory through subjects like Economics of a Nation, Economics of a Firm, Economics of an Industry, and Statistical Analysis.\nEven before the German pedagogical approach called Dualvoc was introduced to the Philippines in the early 1980s, CRC had already decided to use a dual training method for forming "industrial economists" or "business economists." After crafting the curriculum to upskill college graduates we recruited from the best universities, albeit with highly diverse specializations, Jess contacted business enterprises interested in employing industrial and business economists. He proposed a work-study arrangement to them. The "graduate staff" we were upskilling or reskilling through morning classes would immediately apply what they were learning at their respective sponsoring companies in the afternoon. This combination of classroom instruction and on-the-job training was, without our naming it such, a Dualvoc program, as the Germans call it. As I mentioned, our IEP began as early as 1969. The Dualvoc system was formally introduced into the Philippine educational system only in the early 1980s with the emergence of what is now the very successful Dualtech School in Canlubang, which has trained over 10,000 skilled workers in electro-mechanics over the years. Dualtech was established with funding from a German foundation called Hanns Seidel. During Fidel V. Ramos's presidency, the Dual Training Law was passed, formally legalizing the work-study program, which has since evolved into the EBET (Enterprise Based Education and Training) Law.\nToday, the Industrial Economics Program (IEP) is the oldest and most well-known masteral course in economics at the University of Asia and the Pacific (UA&P). It's a five-year, fast-track master’s program for those with advanced quantitative skills and training. Students strong in mathematics typically thrive in this specialization. Graduates of this course earn both a bachelor’s and master’s degree upon completion, making it an excellent option for those wishing to pursue higher education immediately before entering the workforce. With its focus on the analysis of industries and business, it is the only economics program of its kind in the Philippines. Because it zeroes in on economic trends and strategic decision-making, it’s the perfect training ground for future professionals interested in using mathematical concepts and tools within a corporate setting. Over the last 56 years, the IEP has produced over 500 industrial or business economists, some of whom have risen to top management positions, while others have become well-known names in economic and business forecasting, constantly quoted for their expert economic forecasts. To cite just a few examples, the names of Jun Neri, Jun Trinidad, Anton Periquet, Vaughn Montes, Omar Cruz, Tom Aquino, the late Rolly Dy, PJ Garcia, and Nick Mapa have been consistently heralded by the press as leading and credible economic and business forecasters.\nThe original IEP has now come full circle and is being transformed by the UA&P's School of Economics into the Graduate Staff Scholarship Program (GSSP). The GSSP is an honors program for outstanding participants in the Master of Science in Industrial Economics (MSIE) of UA&P. A key feature of the GSSP is to immerse participating scholars in business organizations and assist partner institutions by providing them with highly trained young talents educated in quantitative and qualitative analysis in the allied fields of economics, business, communication skills, teamwork, and business ethics, all supported by a strong liberal arts background. The UA&P School of Economics, together with the host company, will design the internship project, which will involve analyzing an issue determined by the host institution. The School of Economics faculty will then mentor the scholar in crafting strategies to address the issue at hand. This project will form the basis of the intern’s thesis for the Master of Science in Industrial Economics degree.\nThere will be no employer-employee relationship during the GSSP, but the host institution may choose to hire the GSSP interns after the on-the-job engagement. The GSSP will run for 15 weeks per semester (e.g., 2 days a week for the semester—240 hours from August to December 2025 and 240 hours from January to May 2026). The host company will provide a tuition grant of P90,000 per semester, totaling P180,000 for the entire academic year. At the same time, the host company will provide a monthly stipend to GSSP participants from UA&P in keeping with its existing policy.\nFor more information, contact (632) 8632-0912 to 26 local 367.

world-bank-urges-enhancements-of-philippine-building-code	World Bank urges enhancements of Philippine building code	The World Bank is urging the Philippines and many other developing nations to improve not only building standards but also their implementation.\nAccording to a June 10 World Bank report titled “A Global Assessment of Building Codes: Current Status and Evolving Needs to Promote Resilient, Green, and Inclusive Buildings,” a comprehensive analysis of building codes across 22 countries, including the Philippines, showed that “in many of the countries assessed, there is a need to update codes, as they were last updated over a decade ago.”\nThe Philippines and Ghana were cited for having structural design building code documents published in the past decade, while the majority of countries in the report had even older documents.\n“The findings also show a wide range of coverage in the key areas related to the code implementation environment... Priority areas where there are gaps, even in countries with more complete coverage, include processes to ensure building inspections and optimized building control processes to target resources toward higher-risk buildings. These countries include Chile, El Salvador, [and] Mexico with respect to inspections, and the Philippines, South Africa, and Indonesia with respect to optimized processes,” the World Bank said.\n“For example, country experts observed that, in the Philippines and Indonesia, although inspection requirements exist, a lack of resources in building control authorities, in some cases, prevents inspections of common types of smaller-scale buildings from being carried out in practice,” it added.\nAlso, the World Bank flagged that “no retaining wall design provisions were included in the building codes for the Philippines and Nepal.”\nWhile the Philippine building design code was last updated in 2015 and included “complete procedures to develop country-specific wind and seismic design criteria based on country-specific maps,” the World Bank said more can be done to improve it.\n“Areas where the structural design provisions could be strengthened include additional provisions for the design of retaining walls, provisions for the design of seismic isolation systems, and inclusion of design provisions for confined masonry buildings and vernacular timber building types,” the World Bank said.\n“The code lacks simplified structural design provisions for the design and construction of common, small-scale building types. For existing buildings, there is a need to develop provisions for assessment and retrofit, as well as to clarify requirements for building modifications and changes of occupancy,” it added.\nIn addition, “further advancements in the regulations could be made for provisions to address resilience to strong wind events and flooding,” it said.\nOverall, the World Bank said that “the Philippines has a well-established building regulatory framework that contains building design codes addressing key aspects related to structural safety, green building, and accessibility, as well as building control regulations for implementation.”\n“The Philippines’ building control framework establishes clearly defined processes, aided by an online permit system available in various municipalities and easy online access to legal documents. The inspection framework is well defined and integrates the participation of various stakeholders such as fire services. An appeal process and dispute resolution mechanism are in place to address conflict,” the World Bank said.\nFor instance, “the codes for some countries, such as Indonesia, Peru, the Philippines, and Vanuatu, include relatively complete design provisions for diaphragms,” the report said.\nSpecifically, the World Bank cited the Philippines, which faces a comparatively higher level of seismic risk, for updating seismic hazard maps on a regular basis.\nBattered by a string of strong typhoons each year, the Philippines was also named by the World Bank among a few countries having relatively more comprehensive coverage in wind design topic areas among those exposed to risk from cyclonic wind events.\n“Among the countries assessed, Colombia, Mongolia, and the Philippines have the most comprehensive coverage across all wind design topics,” the World Bank said.\n“For example, the National Structural Code of the Philippines (NSCP-2015) has a section for the design of roof cladding and other façade components for wind effects, including load procedures for determining wind pressures for a specific site depending on the wind speed, building height, and roof shape,” the report noted.\nThe Philippines is also among the countries considered to be in the process of developing their green building code provisions, as the World Bank noted that the country already introduced green building regulations during the past decade.\n“Mandatory green building provisions tend to apply to buildings of a certain size and scale, as is the case for Peru, Colombia, Ghana, the Philippines, and Indonesia,” it noted.\nHowever, the World Bank said the Philippines’ green building code still has “some gaps in provisions, including for green roofs, building orientation, renewables, use of recycled materials and low embodied energy design.”\nAnother positive: “Colombia, the Philippines, Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu state in their universal accessibility regulations that people with cognitive impairment need to be considered,” the World Bank said.\nIn the Philippine building code, the World Bank noted that “for universal accessibility, the code covers most key topics, and provisions are mandatory for public buildings and spaces of public use as well as for changes of occupancy to existing public buildings.”\nAN aerial view of the construction of the new government center for Antique in the capital town San Jose de Buenavista.

The report highlights areas for improvement, such as retaining wall designs and seismic isolation systems.  While the Philippines has a well-established framework, the World Bank recommends strengthening the structural design provisions and addressing gaps in green building codes.  The country's regular updates to seismic hazard maps and comprehensive wind design coverage are positive aspects.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/12/world-bank-urges-enhancements-in-philippine-building-code
govt-borrowing-pushes-philippine-foreign-debt-to-1467-billion-in-q1	Gov't borrowing pushes Philippine foreign debt to $146.7 billion in Q1	The Philippines’ outstanding foreign debt rose by 6.6 percent in the first quarter of the year, as the government borrowed more to fund infrastructure and budgetary needs, while private banks tapped foreign lenders for short-term financing to manage liquidity.\nData from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) showed that the country’s foreign debt climbed to $146.7 billion as of March 2025 from $137.6 billion in the previous quarter.\n“The increase in external debt in the first quarter was primarily attributed to the national government’s fund-raising activity meant to support infrastructure projects and other budgetary requirements,” the BSP said in a statement released on Friday, June 13.\nThe national government borrowed a total of $5.1 billion during the period. This amount was acquired through the sale of global bonds and loans from foreign development lenders.\nLocal banks also tapped overseas markets during the period to secure short-term funding for trade activities and liquidity requirements, the BSP said.\nOn an annual basis, the rise in external debt was also attributed to $7.8 billion in government bond issuances and $6.1 billion in foreign borrowings by local banks.\nAs of the first quarter, the country's foreign debt was equivalent to 31.5 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP).\nWhile this was higher than the previous quarter’s 29.8 percent, the BSP said the current level “still reflects the country’s ability to repay its external obligations.”\nAs of end-March, the country’s short-term external debt, based on remaining maturity, reached $32.7 billion.\nFor the BSP, “this level remains well-covered by the country’s gross international reserves (GIR)” or US dollar stock, which amounted to $106.7 billion, providing 3.3 times cover for short-term obligations.\nThe central bank asserted that the country’s US dollar stock level “continues to provide a robust external liquidity buffer, despite the downward trend of the short-term external debt cover in recent years.”\nMeanwhile, the debt service ratio declined to 8.4 percent from nine percent a year earlier. It is another measure of the country’s ability to repay debt, comparing loan payments to earnings from exports and other foreign income sources.\nThe BSP attributed this decline to lower principal and interest payments by resident borrowers in the first quarter.

how-depositing-in-banks-can-help-you-secure-your-money-and-your-goals	How depositing in banks can help you secure your money — and your goals	Year after year, millions of Filipinos make the difficult decision to leave their families or loved ones behind for a chance of earning more and providing them with a better life. Mothers and fathers lose the opportunity to watch their children grow, while young adults or single Filipinos are thrust into the role of becoming breadwinners.\nAccording to data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), the number of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) from April to September 2023 was estimated at 2.16 million, an increase of 9.8% compared to the 1.96 million estimate in 2022.\nMiguel, who has been abroad for close to eight years, narrated that he was able to move to the US with the help of a relative who was already a green card holder. “Hindi madali ang magsimula sa ibang bansa. Kinailangan ko tumanggap ng dalawa o tatlong trabaho para may sapat na maipadala kay mama at mga kapatid ko na nag-aaral pa. (Starting my life here in the US was not easy. I needed to do two to three jobs at a time so I can earn enough money to send back home to my mother and siblings who were still studying.).”\nAfter years of living the so-called “American dream,” Miguel realized that he had his own dreams to fulfill. He started looking for a more stable job and opened a savings account for his personal goals.\nThis is a common tale among several Filipinos working abroad: family comes first, while personal goals get second priority.\nHe shared, “Hindi masamang tumulong sa pamilya, pero kailangan din natin isipin ang sarili natin at yung mga gusto natin ma-experience o ma-achieve, ‘di ba? Kaya ipon-ipon din. (There’s nothing wrong with helping your family, but we also need to think of ourselves and the things we wish to experience or achieve, right? So, we also need to save money whenever we can)”\nGoogle Trends data showed that in 2024, the search term “savings account” generated an average of 79 searches per week in the Philippines, or up by 6% compared to the 74 weekly searches on average in 2023. Related queries included interest rates, requirements, and maintaining balance. The data suggests that more Filipinos may have considered opening a savings account in 2024 than the year before it.\nSaving in banks for future goals is a smart and wise way to ensure that money is kept safe, especially with the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC) around. The PDIC is a government instrumentality with a unique function of safeguarding the interest of the depositing public by providing insurance coverage on all insured deposits.\nThe increased maximum deposit insurance coverage (MDIC) of ₱1 million took effect on March 15, 2025. This increase in the MDIC is seen to help Miguel and several other Filipinos even more in building trust in the banks and in encouraging them to save more in banks.\nWhether it is saving for an immediate need or a future dream, depositors can have the peace of mind that their money is now better protected if they choose to save it in banks.\n“Ang maganda pag sa bangko nag-iipon ay less yung worry na baka manakaw ang pera. At masarap din sa pakiramdam na nakikita mong unti-unting lumalaki ang pera sa bangko at yung thought na malapit ko na ma-reach ang target ko. (The good thing about saving money in banks is that you don’t need to worry about your money being stolen. Aside from that, it also feels good to see your savings grow and know that you are close to reaching your target.),” Miguel concluded, highlighting that saving in banks not only protects our money, but also our personal goals.	"\\tImages/how-depositing-in-banks-can-help-you-secure-your-money-and-your-goals_1.png"	Millions of Filipinos work abroad to provide for their families, often prioritizing family needs over personal goals.  Saving in banks offers a secure way to protect money and achieve personal aspirations, with the PDIC insuring deposits.  Increased deposit insurance coverage encourages Filipinos to save more, providing peace of mind.  Saving in banks not only secures funds but also facilitates the achievement of personal goals.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/16/how-depositing-in-banks-can-help-you-secure-your-money-and-your-goals
govt-scales-back-subsidies-to-state-run-firms-by-over-10	Gov't scales back subsidies to state-run firms by over 10%	Government subsidies to state-run firms decreased by 10.2 percent to ₱37.1 billion in the first four months of 2025, compared to ₱47.3 billion in the same period a year ago, as the Marcos administration scaled back funding for major non-financial and financial government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs).\nData from the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) showed that the double-digit decline in subsidies was driven by reduced funding support for major state-owned non-financial and financial corporations.\nSubsidies for major non-financial corporations shrank by 42.1 percent to ₱17.9 billion in the four-month period, compared to ₱31 billion in the previous year. It made up 48.2 percent of the year-to-date subsidies.\nSubsidies for the National Irrigation Administration (NIA), which accounted for 65.9 percent of the total support for major non-financial firms, fell sharply by 45.7 percent to ₱11.8 billion from ₱21.7 billion.\nNotably, the support NIA received for the first four months was about the same amount it had received in April alone last year at ₱11.4 billion. The NIA is primarily responsible for developing and managing irrigation systems to support the country’s agricultural sector.\nGovernment subsidies for the National Housing Authority (NHA) also decreased by 19.8 percent to ₱3 billion from ₱3.74 billion a year earlier.\nDuring the period, government financial institutions (GFIs) only received ₱509 million, marking a significant 80.3 percent drop from ₱2.6 billion last year. Subsidies to GFIs accounted for 1.4 percent of the total for the January–April period.\nMeanwhile, other GOCCs, which accounted for over half of the end-April subsidies, posted a 35.9-percent increase to ₱18.7 billion from ₱13.8 billion a year ago.\nThe Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) received ₱1.9 billion during the period. The government gave zero subsidy to the agency last year.\nAdditionally, the Philippine Crop Insurance Corporation (PCIC), which was not in the list last year, benefited from the ₱2.3 billion provided by the government in the first four months.\nIt can be recalled that the Marcos administration’s subsidies to GOCCs last year were the lowest in six years.\nGOCCs received a total of ₱138.8 billion in state subsidies from January to December 2024, a 15-percent drop compared to ₱163.5 billion in 2023. The 2024 full-year subsidy figure was the lowest since 2018’s ₱136.7 billion.\nIt was also significantly lower than the peak of over ₱229 billion in 2020—at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, when the national government provided wage subsidies to workers in severely affected small businesses and distributed cash aid to vulnerable sectors during the peak of the strictest lockdown to contain the deadly virus.\nDuring the current Marcos administration, last year’s subsidies were the lowest annual support to GOCCs to date.

jollibees-appetite-for-korea-grows-with-reported-norang-food-buyout	Jollibee's appetite for Korea grows with reported Norang Food buyout	Currently savoring the positive impact of its recently acquired Compose Coffee in South Korea, Asian food and beverage giant Jollibee Foods Corporation is reportedly acquiring Korean fried chicken chain owner Norang Food for $95 million in August this year.\nAccording to The Korea Times, Jollibee’s Korean subsidiary has been selected as the preferred bidder to acquire full ownership of the Norang Tongdak (yellow chicken) franchise from private equity firms Corstone Asia and Q Capital Partners.\nAbacus Securities Corporation, the deal is valued at about 10 times its 2023 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA).\n“This is the second entry of JFC into the South Korean market after its Compose Coffee acquisition last year, which was worth about $340 million.\n“Both franchise-heavy acquisitions are looking in line with JFC's ambitions of tripling its net income by 2028 and are focusing on growing its international business through an asset-light or franchising model,” it noted.\nAbacus added that, “Norang Food was also said to have grown its operating profits by 11 percent last year, better than JFC International's average.”\nWhile the acquisition is relatively smaller compared to Compose Coffee, the brokerage said this continues to be a step in the right direction for JFC in achieving its 2028 targets.\nChinabank Capital Corporation Managing Director Juan Paolo Colet said “Jollibee is clearly bullish on the Korean market and, in the case of Norang Tongdak, Korean fried chicken.”\n“The acquisition is also consistent with Jollibee’s aim to generate 50 percent of revenues from its international business,” he added.\nUnicapital Securities Research Analyst Jeri R. Alfonso said “JFC continues to expand its footprint in the Korean market, and we view the move as strategically sound and potentially value-accretive.\n“For one, Norang Tongdak’s store count has jumped from 400 in 2020 to over 750 today, which points to strong momentum and brand acceptance.”\nShe noted that, “While this latest expansion may not match the scale of Compose Coffee, leaning into markets where they are already performing well is the right call, especially with certain regions still dealing with tariff-related headwinds.”\nFor the first quarter of 2025, Jollibee reported that its international business delivered strong system-wide sales (SWS) performance, bolstered by the acquisition of Compose Coffee, which contributed 17.8 percent to the international business' SWS growth.\nJFC’s Coffee and Tea segment — now comprising 45.4 percent of the international business' SWS —recorded a 62.2 percent increase, with Compose Coffee accounting for 49 percent of this growth.	"\\tImages/jollibees-appetite-for-korea-grows-with-reported-norang-food-buyout_1.png"	Jollibee Foods Corporation is acquiring Norang Food for $95 million, its second South Korean acquisition following Compose Coffee.  This aligns with Jollibee's goal of tripling net income by 2028 and generating 50% of revenue internationally. Norang Food's strong growth and brand acceptance make this a strategic move for Jollibee. The acquisition is viewed as value-accretive and supports Jollibee's expansion in the Korean market.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/13/jollibees-appetite-for-korea-grows-with-reported-norang-food-buyout
maynilad-customers-to-pay-more-manila-water-less-in-q3-2025	Maynilad customers to pay more, Manila Water less, in Q3 2025	The Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) has reported an increase in Maynilad Water Services Inc.'s water bills for the third quarter.\nIn a briefing on Friday, June 13, MWSS Regulatory Office (RO) Chief Regulator Patrick Ty shared that Maynilad customers will see a slight uptick in their water bills from July to September.\nAccording to the approved foreign currency differential adjustment (FCDA), Maynilad will marginally increase its rate by ₱0.01 for residents consuming 10 cubic meters or less (cu.m/less), while those with 20 cu.m/less will increase its rates by ₱0.05. Consumers of 30 cu.m/less will also see a ₱0.11 rise.\nEnhanced lifeline consumers will not be affected by these rates.\nFCDA is a tariff mechanism reviewed every quarter that allows water concessionaires to adjust rates based on gains or losses from fluctuations in foreign exchange (forex) rates.\n“Maynilad, which provides water and wastewater services to the west concession area, will implement an FCDA of -0.64 percent of its 2025 average basic charge of ₱52.40 per cu.m, or -₱0.329 per cu.m,” Ty explained.\n“From an implemented FCDA of -₱00.334 per cu.m in the second quarter, the tariff shall be adjusted upward by an average of ₱0.005 per cu.m.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nAccording to the MWSS chief, the upcoming price adjustments are due to the peso weakening against the yen and euro, despite gaining strength against the United States (US) dollar.\n“Maynilad and Manila Water [Co. Inc.] have different foreign currency loan mix,” he added.\nOn the other hand, Manila Water customers will see a slight reduction in their billings, as those consuming 10 cu.m/less would have a ₱0.55 decrease, 20 cu.m/less with ₱1.20, while those with 30 cu.m/less will get a ₱2.45 discount in their billings for the third quarter of this year.\n“Manila Water, which serves the east concession area, will apply an FCDA of 1.12 percent of its 2025 average basic charge of ₱47.10 per cu.m, or ₱0.52 per cu.m. From an implemented FCDA of ₱0.65 per cu.m in the second quarter, the tariff shall be adjusted downward by an average of ₱0.12 per cu.m.\nBoth adjustments from the concessionaires will take effect on July 1.	"\\tImages/maynilad-customers-to-pay-more-manila-water-less-in-q3-of-2025_1.png"	Maynilad customers will experience slight water bill increases in Q3 2025 due to the FCDA adjustment, while Manila Water customers will see a reduction.  The adjustments are based on foreign exchange rate fluctuations affecting the peso against the yen and euro.  Maynilad's rate increase varies based on consumption, while Manila Water's decrease also depends on consumption levels. Both changes take effect July 1st.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/13/maynilad-customers-to-pay-more-manila-water-less-in-q3-of-2025
how-deposit-insurance-can-be-a-lifeline-during-unforeseen-circumstances	How deposit insurance can be a lifeline during unforeseen circumstances	Waking up to a home flooded up to hip level or reporting for work only to find out you have been let go by the company are scenarios one would wish were just a bad dream. For Karla and Paulo, however, this was their reality when Typhoon Ondoy and the global pandemic happened, respectively. Faced with the sudden dilemma, they found themselves asking: How do I begin again?\nEmergency situations such as natural calamities and virus outbreaks strike without warning. Having a savings account—or better yet an emergency fund, can spell the difference between feeling helpless and having peace of mind.\nKarla and her family lost almost all of their belongings, but thankfully the money she tucked in the bank was left unharmed. “Buti na lang may savings ako. Maliit man o malaki na sakuna, importante na ready ka, na may savings ka sa bangko para may mahuhugot ka. Hindi mo need maghintay ng tulong sa iba dahil kaya mong tulungan ang sarili mo at ang pamilya mo. (It was a good thing I had my savings in a bank. Whether it is a small or big calamity, it is important that you are ready, that you have savings in the bank that you can use. That way, you won’t need to wait on others for help because you are capable of helping yourself and your family)”, Karla recalled with a sense of relief.\nThis sense of security in the banking system is exactly what the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC) aims when fulfilling its twin public policy objectives of protecting depositors and promoting financial stability. As the state deposit insurer, the PDIC provides a financial safety net through deposit insurance to depositors of banks up to the maximum coverage amount set by law.\nIn Paulo’s case, his unforeseen emergency was brought about by COVID-19. The pandemic not only taught him that nothing is permanent but also stressed the importance of saving money in banks. As the family’s breadwinner, he immediately needed to find another way to earn a living after being laid off. That was when he tried delivery work.\n“Dati wala akong effort para mag-ipon sa bangko. Lahat ng sinasahod ko napupunta agad sa mga bilihin at mga babayarin. Nung nawalan ako bigla ng trabaho, dun ko na realize na ang hirap pala pag wala kang naitabi. Kaya ngayon, kahit pa ₱10 o ₱20 lang na extra, kapag pinagsama-sama malaking dagdag na rin para sa emergency fund. (I used to not make an effort to save in banks. What I earn went straight to buying the necessities and paying the bills. When I suddenly lost my job, that was the only time I realized just how hard it is when you have nothing saved. So now, I save even if it is just an extra ₱10 or ₱20 to add to the emergency fund),” he said.\nAccording to a report by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), as of September 2024, more than 450 cities and municipalities in the country remain unbanked. This means that many Filipinos may still be unaware of the benefits of saving in banks and having their hard-earned money protected by the PDIC.\nTo sustain the protection the PDIC provides to depositors, it continuously strengthens the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), the funding source of deposit insurance built primarily through the collection of semi-annual assessments from banks.\nStarting March 15, 2025, the DIF guarantees that deposits up to the maximum deposit insurance coverage (MDIC) of ₱1 million per depositor per bank are protected. This is double the previous MDIC of ₱500,000, which was last adjusted in 2009.\nThis increase in the MDIC not only demonstrates the stability of the DIF but also ensures more deposit accounts are insured, thus reinforcing public trust and confidence in the banking system. Hopefully, more individuals, like Karla and Paulo, can confidently choose to save in banks, knowing that the PDIC is their ally in safeguarding their savings and the welfare of their family during challenging times.	"\\tImages/how-deposit-insurance-can-be-a-lifeline-during-unforeseen-circumstances_1.png"	Emergency funds are crucial during unforeseen circumstances like natural calamities or job loss.  Karla's bank savings proved invaluable after Typhoon Ondoy.  Paulo, laid off during the pandemic, learned the importance of saving, even small amounts. The Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC) protects deposits, increasing public trust in the banking system.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/16/how-deposit-insurance-can-be-a-lifeline-during-unforeseen-circumstances
israel-iran-conflict-seen-weighing-on-further-bsp-interest-rate-cuts	Israel-Iran conflict seen weighing on further BSP interest rate cuts	Israel's attack on Iran may pause monetary policy easing by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) while also weakening the peso, according to foreign banks.\n“We think that the spike in oil prices on June 13 due to the Israel-Iran conflict is unlikely to derail the BSP's decision to cut this month, but it could weigh on the central bank's decision in the subsequent August meeting,” Deutsche Bank Research economist Junjie Huang said in a June 14 report.\nDeutsche Bank Research earlier projected the BSP's policy-making Monetary Board (MB) to cut key interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) each in its June 19 and Aug. 28 policy meetings.\nFor Huang, what is certain for now is Thursday's 25-bp reduction in the policy rate to 5.25 percent from 5.5 percent at present, mainly on the back of three consecutive months of below-target headline inflation.\nThe year-on-year rate of increase in prices of basic goods and services further fell to a 5.5-year low of 1.3 percent in May, bringing the five-month average to 1.9 percent—below the targeted two- to four-percent range deemed manageable and conducive to economic growth.\n“We think that both supply and demand downside pressures would likely keep inflation subdued in the coming months,” Huang said.\nBut for Japanese financial giant MUFG Bank Ltd., tensions between Israel and Iran may turn inflationary while putting depreciation pressure on oil import-reliant currencies like the peso.\n“Brent oil prices rose to as much as $78 per barrel as hostilities between Israel and Iran continued for the fourth day, with safe-haven assets such as gold prices picking up, coupled with some modest Asian FX [foreign exchange] weakness against the dollar as markets opened,” noted MUFG Global Markets Research senior currency analyst Michael Wan in a June 16 report.\n“We had Asian currencies generally on the backfoot and weaker against the dollar, with the likes of the Indian rupee, Philippine peso, and South Korean won underperforming the region heading into the weekend,” Wan said.\nThe peso dropped to the ₱56:$1 level last Friday.\n“The dispersion of outcomes makes sense to our minds with the geopolitical conflict, given that India, the Philippines, and South Korea are meaningful net oil importers, while for Asia overall higher oil prices could add to both inflation and trade deficits more generally,” Wan added.\nMore expensive oil for a net importer like the Philippines would bloat the trade-in-goods as well as current account—or net dollar earnings—deficits, potentially further weakening the peso.\nJust like Deutsche Bank, MUFG sees the Middle Eastern conflict as a potential deterrent to consecutive BSP interest rate reductions.\n“We see these geopolitical tensions as probably delaying the path of rate cuts across Asian central banks, including from the likes of India, the Philippines, and perhaps South Korea, but should not change the ultimate destination” of monetary policy easing, Wan said.\nSingapore-based DBS Bank Ltd. also stood pat in its expectation that the BSP would lower the key borrowing cost by 50 bps to reach the “terminal” level of five percent in the third quarter of this year, starting with the anticipated June 19 rate cut.\n“With inflation rising by the slowest pace in six years of 1.3 percent year-on-year in May, real rate buffer is significant,” DBS Group Research chief economist Taimur Baig and FX and credit strategist Chang Wei Liang said in a June 16 report.\n“Add to this, incoming activity-based indicators have been mixed besides the overhang of global uncertainties. This is likely to strengthen the case to lower rates further this quarter, followed up by another likely rate cut in the third quarter,” DBS said, referring to the BSP's June and August monetary policy meetings.	"\\tImages/israel-iran-conflict-seen-weighing-on-philippine-interest-rates-peso_1.png"	The Israel-Iran conflict might cause the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) to pause its monetary policy easing, potentially weakening the peso.  Higher oil prices due to the conflict could add to inflation and trade deficits.  Foreign banks have differing views on the impact on the BSP's interest rate decisions.  Some believe the June rate cut will proceed, but subsequent cuts might be delayed.  The peso's depreciation to ₱56:$1 reflects the ongoing geopolitical uncertainty.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/16/israel-iran-conflict-seen-weighing-on-philippine-interest-rates-peso
mbc-urges-strict-implementation-of-key-economic-reforms	MBC urges strict implementation of key economic reforms	The influential Makati Business Club (MBC) is urging the government to ensure the strict implementation of three vital measures aimed at economic reform, which are nearing approval by President Marcos.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, June 17, MBC commended the 19th Congress for ratifying measures that aim to position the Philippines as an attractive investment destination.\nLast week, the Senate and the House of Representatives approved the final versions of the amendments to the Right-of-Way Act and Foreign Investors’ Long-Term Lease Act, as well as the bill proposing the E-Governance Act.\nThe three bills are identified as priority measures of the Marcos administration under the Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council (LEDAC).\nOnce enacted into law, the MBC said these measures will help the country entice more foreign investments.\nThese new investments, according to the business group, will not only accelerate key infrastructure projects in the country, it will also improve transparency in the government.\n“MBC advocates for improvements in governance, infrastructure, and transparency as key drivers to attract more investors, thereby creating more jobs,” the group said.\n“We believe that these reforms are aligned with these advocacies,” it added.\nThe proposed Accelerated and Reformed Right-of-Way Act, which will amend the Right-of-Way Act, is seen as the government’s measure to fast-track major infrastructure projects.\nKey projects, such as the Metro Manila Subway project and Metro Rail Transit Line 7 (MRT-7), have faced numerous delays due to issues related to right-of-way acquisitions.\nWith this proposed legislation, the government seeks to streamline the process for acquiring land and related assets needed for infrastructure projects.\nMeanwhile, amendments to the Foreign Investors’ Long-Term Lease Act include extending foreign leases in the country to 99 years from the current 75 years.\nThis will align the Philippines with neighboring countries Singapore (99-year lease), Malaysia (99 years), and Indonesia (95 years).\nBusiness groups have long called for the passage of this measure in order to attract investors who are looking for long-term security.\nLastly, the proposed E-Governance Act aims to streamline government processes by institutionalizing a national framework for a unified digital government system.\nOnce enacted, this bill is envisioned to make government processes more transparent, potentially cutting red tape.\nThis is yet another crucial move to enhance the ease of doing business in the country.\n“We hope that the proper implementation of these reforms will achieve the intended goal of enhancing the country’s competitiveness,” said MBC.

govt-leverages-stable-costs-exceeds-25-billion-borrowing-ceiling	Gov't leverages stable costs, exceeds ₱25 billion borrowing ceiling	Despite weaker investor demand and marginally higher interest costs, the government continued exceeding its ₱25-billion borrowing target, raising ₱26.7 billion from short-term debt papers, as it took advantage of still relatively stable borrowing costs ahead of potential inflation pressures and delayed interest rate cuts due to global factors.\nAt the latest Treasury bills (T-bills) auction on Monday, June 16, the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) awarded more than its planned fund-raising, with total bids reaching ₱74.2 billion, just nearly three times the amount offered.\nThis week’s total bids were lower than the ₱98 billion in tenders from the previous T-bill auction on June 9.\nThe government awarded ₱6.5 billion, falling short of the ₱8-billion offering for 91-day T-bills. Total tenders reached ₱19.4 billion. The average rate was 5.459 percent, slightly higher than the previous week’s 5.451-percent rate.\nNotably, the BTr awarded ₱11.2 billion for 182-day debt papers, exceeding the ₱8 billion offered amount. Bids reached ₱29.7 billion. It fetched an average rate of 5.523 percent, slightly lower than last week’s 5.524 percent.\nPreviously awarded above the target, the BTr now borrowed the planned ₱9 billion through 364-day IOUs. Demand reached ₱25.1 billion. The average rate inched up slightly to 5.657 percent from 5.656 percent in the previous auction.\nPrior to Monday’s auction, PHP Bloomberg Valuation (PHP BVAL) Reference Rates showed that the 91-, 182-, and 364-day T-bills were quoted at 5.440 percent, 5.570 percent, and 5.692 percent, respectively.\nOnly the benchmark rate for the three-month government securities dropped from the previous week. Benchmark rates for the six-month and one-year securities went up.\nThe average rate for three-month T-bills was lower than the key borrowing costs of 5.5 percent. Meanwhile, longer-dated IOUs stood higher than the benchmark.\nAccording to Michael Ricafort, chief economist at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. (RCBC), T-bill auction yields saw marginal increases, remaining largely stable after the recent Israel-Iran conflict pushed global crude oil prices to their highest in four months and the US dollar-peso exchange rate to ₱56.50:$1.\nRicafort said this development could lead to higher import costs and inflation, potentially affecting future US Federal Reserve (Fed) and Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) rate cuts. The markets are eyeing a possible quarter point cut in the upcoming June 19 policy meeting.

lepanto-profits-surge-40-times-as-gold-prices-continue-to-rise	Lepanto profits surge 40 times as gold prices continue to rise	Yap-led Lepanto Consolidated Mining Co. reported that its net income surged 40 times to ₱659 million in the first five months of 2025 from the ₱16 million earned in the same period last year, as it ramped up production amid rising gold prices.\nIn a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE), the firm said the increase is attributable to the 23-percent growth in production—from 8,258 ounces of gold to 10,151 ounces—and the higher gold price of $3,035 per ounce, compared with $2,182 per ounce last year.\nIn contrast, Lepanto said the increase in its expenses was relatively minimal, at nine percent compared with last year.\n“Lepanto continues to produce gold from the Victoria and Teresa deposits. All efforts on equipment acquisition and upgrades are focused on improving productivity and metal recoveries.\n“Presently, there are five active drill rigs drilling for both grade control and exploration, with encouraging results,” the company said.\nAbacus Securities Corp. noted that Lepanto beat all listed miners in terms of improved earnings from the first quarter of 2023, which is before gold’s run-up started, to the first quarter of 2025.\nNet income reached ₱391 million in the first quarter this year, nearly triple the level in the same period a year ago.\nThe realized price for gold in the first quarter of 2025 was $2,890 an ounce, up 39 percent year-on-year. As of the first week of June, the average price is $3,260, or 13-percent higher versus the first quarter.\n“This indicates another solid quarter for both earnings and cash flows which might make it unnecessary to conduct any capital-raising exercise in the near to medium term,” Abacus said.\nLepanto is still looking for a new partner for its Far Southeast gold prospect, which has an inferred resource of 891.7 million tons of ore containing 0.7 grams per ton of gold and 0.5-percent copper.

govt-borrows-below-target-28-billion-through-treasury-bonds-amid-elevated-interest-costs	Gov't borrows below-target ₱28 billion through treasury bonds amid elevated interest costs	The Marcos administration has borrowed below its planned ₱30 billion through the sale of long-term debt securities, as the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) rejected bids seeking higher interest rates amid continued tensions between Israel and Iran.\nAt the auction on Tuesday, June 17, the BTr awarded only ₱27.6 billion in reissued 10-year treasury bonds (T-bonds).\nTenders totaled ₱55.4 billion, nearly twice the amount offered.\nBut this week’s demand was weaker than the ₱57.7 billion tendered by government securities eligible dealers (GSEDs) during last week’s auction for 7.25-year T-bonds.\nWith a remaining term of nine years and 10 months before maturity, the bond’s yield was capped at an annual rate of 6.428 percent. This was significantly higher than the previous auction’s 6.124 percent.\nIt was also 4.8-basis-point (bp) higher than the 6.38-percent rate for comparable corporate bonds in the secondary market, based on the PHP Bloomberg Valuation (BVAL) Service Reference Rate.\nThe total outstanding amount for this T-bond series stood at ₱367.6 billion, the BTr said in a statement.\nRizal Commercial Banking Corp. (RCBC) chief economist Michael Ricafort said bond interest rates jumped to an 11-month high due to geopolitical tensions and global economic concerns.\nHe attributed the uptick to the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict, which pushed up global oil prices and the United States (US) dollar-Philippine peso exchange rate, raising inflation risks.\nThe Philippines borrows more locally, through the issuance of treasury bills and bonds, than from foreign sources. This borrowing strategy leverages domestic banks and creditors who are flush with cash, while mitigating exposure to foreign exchange (forex) risks and volatility.\nThe national government’s outstanding debt was equivalent to 62 percent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter, its highest level in two years. It climbed from 60.7 percent at the end of 2024.\nSpecifically, domestic debt stood at 42.3 percent of GDP, while foreign debt had a GDP ratio of 19.7 percent.

marcos-admin-sets-2026-national-budget-priorities-no-ceiling-yet	Marcos admin sets 2026 national budget priorities; no ceiling yet	The Marcos administration, through the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), has already set its national budget priorities for 2026 based on the government’s medium-term development plan.\nGiven the country’s “limited fiscal space,” new budget proposals will be evaluated based on their alignment with the Marcos administration’s priorities, readiness for implementation, and the absorptive capacity of implementing agencies.\nBased on the 2026 budget priorities framework briefer published early June, infrastructure development is the government’s first priority in the list. It includes investments in active transport, integrated water resources, agriculture and healthcare facilities, and digital connectivity.\nThis will support the ambitious “Build Better More” program, which aims to roll out the 207 big-ticket infrastructure flagship projects (IFPs) worth ₱10.1 trillion in the government’s pipeline.\nHuman capital development is the second budget priority. The government aims to expand access to quality healthcare and education, strengthen the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps), and generate more job opportunities through workforce upskilling and retraining.\nTo boost food and water security as the third priority, the government plans to build and upgrade modern postharvest facilities and invest in multipurpose projects that combine irrigation, flood control, and water supply systems.\nFourth on the list is industry development, which aims to boost domestic manufacturing, expand Negosyo Centers to more local government units (LGUs), upgrade One Town, One Product (OTOP) stores into multifunctional hubs, and promote diverse tourism through the Philippine Experience Program.\nFifth is research and development (R&D) and innovation efforts, which focus on supporting startup incubation programs, expanding scholarships in key innovation fields, and strengthening collaboration among the government, academe, and industry.\nDigitalization is also in the priority list, aiming to invest in technologies that streamline government services and ensure integration and interoperability across national government digital systems.\nLastly, environmental, climate, and disaster resilience made it to the cut of 2026 budget priorities. It would cover setting up marine research stations, enhancing disaster preparedness through capacity-building, and integrating the Department of Social Welfare and Development’s (DSWD) adaptive and shock-responsive social protection system into broader government response mechanisms.\nSought for comment on the progress of the 2026 budget preparation, DBM Secretary Amenah Pangandaman told Manila Bulletin that updates will be made available soon.\nThe Cabinet-level Development Budget Coordination Committee (DBCC) has yet to set a ceiling for next year’s spending plan despite budget season fast-approaching as the 20th Congress opens in July.\nDetails on this matter could be available on Monday, June 22, as the continuation of the DBCC meeting will be held on that date, disclosed Pangandaman, who chairs the interagency committee.\nBased on the budget cycle, technical budget hearings are being conducted during the months of June and July, and the Tier 2 proposals of government agencies are being reviewed by the Executive Review Board (ERB).\nTier 2 covers proposed new and expansion priority programs and projects (PAPs) on top of ongoing PAPs under Tier 1.\nAs of May, agency budget proposals for 2026 have already ballooned to around ₱11 trillion, surpassing this year’s ₱9.2-trillion worth of funding requests. The DBM had said this was due to numerous PAPs being eagerly pushed by agencies.\nAs such, the 2026 budget proposal is expected to exceed 2025’s ₱6.326-trillion appropriations and reach a new record high.\nIt can be recalled that former President Rodrigo Duterte alleged that President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. signed blank pages in the proposed 2025 national budget, likening it to a blank check. The DBM later on denied the claim.\nPresident Marcos also allocated zero budget for state health insurer PhilHealth in this year’s budget, citing the agency’s ₱600 billion in reserve funds—a move that has drawn several criticisms from the public.

lufthansa-systems-pratt-whitney-partner-with-cebu-pacific-for-enhanced-fleet-crew-management	Lufthansa Systems, Pratt & Whitney partner with Cebu Pacific for enhanced fleet, crew management	Low-cost carrier Cebu Pacific has signed new agreements with foreign aviation companies covering operations and maintenance, as the airline prepares to expand into new domestic and international destinations.\nIn separate statements on Tuesday, June 17, the Gokongwei-led airline announced that it has signed agreements with German information technology (IT) provider Lufthansa Systems and American aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney.\nLufthansa Systems, the IT arm of the Lufthansa Group, is set to integrate its next-generation operations control and crew management solution into Cebu Pacific.\nWith the implementation set to begin this year, Cebu Pacific said it will soon utilize Lufthansa Systems’ NetLine as its new operations control system.\nThe system collects and evaluates a wide range of data, including weather conditions and airspace constraints, which will then alert the operations control team to situations that may impact operations, crew, or customers.\nBy having access to these proactive measures, the airline is able to mitigate and resolve disruptions in a more timely manner.\nMeanwhile, the crew management solution will leverage machine learning and high-speed optimization to shorten rostering cycles.\nThrough this technology, Cebu Pacific is poised to deliver robust resource planning, supporting a more balanced and predictable scheduling for the crew.\nCebu Pacific Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Mike Szucs said these investments into the airline’s internal infrastructure will enhance safety, operational resilience, efficiency, and crew wellbeing.\nSzucs said improvements to operations are substantial drivers for the airline’s continued growth in its fleet and network.\n“This is all about preparing Cebu Pacific to capture the outstanding opportunity that presents itself both in the Philippines and across the broader Asian market,” he said.\nIn support of this vision, Cebu Pacific has signed a 12-year agreement with Pratt & Whitney for maintenance services to maintain the performance and efficiency of the airline’s fleet.\nIn particular, Pratt & Whitney would provide support for the airline’s GTF (geared turbofan) engine fleet, which it ordered from the American company last year.\nCebu Pacific earlier procured GTF engines to power 15 single-aisle aircraft.\nThe maintenance support will likewise cover Cebu Pacific’s ₱1.4 trillion order of up to 152 A321 new engine option (NEO) aircraft from European manufacturer Airbus, which was the largest aircraft order in the country’s aviation history.\n“This agreement strengthens our ability to scale sustainably while continuing to deliver on our commitments to passengers,” said Szucs.\nWith 98 aircraft already under its arsenal, Cebu Pacific is set to increase it to 100 by the year-end.\nThe budget carrier operates in 37 domestic and 26 international destinations.

(SM Prime), one of Southeast Asia’s largest integrated property developers, reporting a 15 percent increase in first-quarter foot traffic at its flagship Mall of Asia (MOA) Complex.\nThe firm said that visits to the MOA Complex climbed to 34.5 million during the first quarter, fueled by a strong slate of events, led by the return of the Philippine International Pyromusical Competition, which featured top-tier fireworks teams from around the world and sharply boosted evening visits.\nTo put this impressive figure into perspective, 34.5 million visits in just three months at the MOA Complex is comparable to the entire population of Peru, which is estimated to be around 34.58 million people.\nThe quarter also saw high-profile concerts from global acts including Maroon 5, NIKI, Wave to Earth and K-pop stars Baekhyun and Taeyeon. Major sporting events like the UAAP volleyball season attracted also large university crowds.\n“The Mall of Asia Complex demonstrates how our integrated, experience-led strategy—from retail and offices to education and entertainment—drives sustained foot traffic. It’s the SM ecosystem in full effect,” said SM Prime President Jeffrey C. Lim.\nThe MOA Complex, SM Prime’s first integrated estate, is home to some of the Philippines’ largest and most modern commercial properties—including SM Mall of Asia, SMX Convention Center Manila, MOA Arena and SM MOA IMAX. It also houses the world’s largest IKEA store.\n“We are seeing sustained momentum toward experience-driven consumption so we are aligning our event strategy to capture that demand,” added Lim.\nSM Prime reported a first-quarter consolidated net income up by 11 percent increase from the previous year, driven primarily by the performance of its mall segment.\nTo sustain its growth momentum, SM Prime has outlined a three-pronged strategy of organic expansion, regional development and bold diversification. Lim said he expects integrated property developments and premium residential projects to drive growth over the next five years.\nLocated in Pasay City and spanning 60 hectares, the MOA Complex is SM Prime’s flagship integrated estate. Anchored by SM Mall of Asia—one of the largest malls in the world—the complex also features residential developments, office buildings, a convention center, events arena, hotels, an amusement park and an academic institution.

hsbc-sees-peso-at-55-by-year-end-amid-possible-bsp-rate-cut-to-support-services	HSBC sees peso at ₱55 by year-end amid possible BSP rate cut to support services	HSBC expects the Philippine peso to strengthen to the ₱55 level by year-end, a trend that could be supported by a widely expected potential cut by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) to counter the decline in the services sector due to a “stronger” peso.\nIn an HSBC investment outlook report released on June 19, the bank said the growth in the business process outsourcing (BPO) sector has slowed down due to the pressure on the country’s external competitiveness.\n“With external competitiveness under pressure, especially from an appreciating peso, the BPO sector showed signs of moderation, growing just 1.7 percent—well below its historical average,” HSBC said.\n“As a result, the BSP can potentially cut rates ahead of the US Federal Reserve to support domestic conditions while maintaining currency stability,” said James Cheo, chief investment officer of HSBC global private banking and premier wealth, Southeast Asia and India.\nCheo said the peso is “expected to trade around >₱55 to the US dollar by year-end, supported by monetary easing and a stable macroeconomic backdrop.”\nLate last year, the BSP started cutting interest rates to support the slowing economy and tame inflation. To date, a total of 100 basis points (bps) has been reduced from the key borrowing costs, bringing the policy rate down to 5.5 percent from 6.5 before the easing.\nLast week, HSBC ASEAN economist Aris Dacanay cited favorable inflation as the major factor to the central bank’s expected decision to further reduce key borrowing costs by a quarter point.\n“Due to low inflation over the past two months and slow growth in the first quarter of 2025, we now expect the BSP to cut its policy rate by 25 bps to 5.25 percent [this] week,” Dacanay said. He earlier expected the BSP to hold rates on Thursday, June 19, taking into account the US Fed’s cautious stance on rate cuts.\nMay’s 1.3-percent inflation was the slowest in five-and-a-half years, or since November 2019, when it stood at 1.2 percent. It fell way below the target band of the government, at two to four percent.\nIt was also at the midpoint of the BSP’s 0.9- to 1.7-percent projection.\nHSBC noted that Philippine gross domestic product (GDP) growth remains “healthy, driven by domestic consumption.” It accelerated by 5.4 percent in the first quarter, below expectations.\nBut the bank expects the Philippine economy to grow by 5.6 percent this year, placing it among the fastest-growing economies in Asia.	"\\tImages/hsbc-sees-peso-at-55-by-year-end-amid-possible-bsp-rate-cut-to-support-services_1.png"	HSBC forecasts the Philippine peso to reach ₱55 by year-end, potentially aided by a BSP rate cut.  Slower BPO growth due to peso appreciation prompted the prediction.  The BSP may cut rates to bolster the economy amid low inflation.

marilao-bridge-struck-again-dotr-suspends-nlex-toll-collection-demands-accountability	Marilao bridge struck again: DOTr suspends NLEX toll collection, demands accountability	The Department of Transportation (DOTr) has ordered the private operator of the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) to suspend toll collection at the northbound segment in Marilao, Bulacan, following another crash at the Marilao Interchange Bridge involving an overheight truck.\nIn a notice addressed to NLEX Corp., the DOTr expressed its “profound concern and disappointment over the recurring incidents of overheight vehicles striking critical infrastructure” along NLEX.\nThe most recent incident, according to the DOTr, is an “unacceptable failure of operational diligence.”\nThe agency, headed by Secretary Vince Dizon, said the operator’s failure to implement comprehensive preventive protocols “demonstrates an alarming lack of proactive risk management and a grave breach of duty to the public.”\nAs a reprieve for motorists affected by the traffic congestion due to repair works, the DOTr has directed NLEX Corp. to suspend the collection of tolls until all four lanes are passable.\n“This directive shall remain in force until public convenience, safety, and normal traffic flow are satisfactorily restored,” the letter read, signed by Dizon.\nThe Marilao Interchange Bridge was again struck by an overheight container on Wednesday, June 18, causing heavy traffic on the NLEX.\nAccording to Marilao police, the impact of the crash detached a girder in the bridge, which fell onto an incoming Asian utility vehicle (AUV), killing one person and injuring several others.\nNLEX Corp. has been ordered to provide financial, medical, and logistical assistance to the family of the deceased and the injured parties.\nIn March, the Marilao Interchange Bridge was struck by an 18-wheeler truck that exceeded its vertical clearance, resulting in severe damage to two bridge girders.\nThe subsequent repair work resulted in over a week of heavy traffic on the NLEX.\nNLEX Corp. waived fees during this period.\nThe DOTr stated that as a public utility operator, NLEX Corp. bears a legal and moral obligation to maintain the highest standards of safety and service.\nAs such, the agency is requesting that the company submit a written explanation to justify why it should not impose administrative sanctions.\nNLEX Corp. is also directed to submit a safety improvement plan covering the 84-kilometer highway.\nThe DOTr is recommending that the operator install automated overheight vehicle detection systems, structural retrofitting or protective reinforcement of overhead structures, and protocols for real-time incident reporting and rapid response.\n“Failure to comply with these directives shall be deemed a willful violation of your obligations under the STOA (Supplemental Toll Operation Agreement) and related laws, and may warrant the imposition of full regulatory sanctions,” it said.\nThese sanctions include administrative penalties, suspension of toll collection rights, and revocation or amendment of NLEX’s operating authority under the Toll Regulatory Board and the DOTr.\n“The department will not hesitate to enforce all available remedies under law to protect the motoring public and uphold public safety,” the letter read.

us-fda-ends-import-restrictions-for-mang-tomas-ufc-jufran	US FDA ends import restrictions for Mang Tomas, UFC, Jufran	The US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) has lifted import restrictions on three popular Filipino sauces.\nIn a statement, Nutriasia announced that the US FDA has officially approved on May 16, 2025 the company’s petition to remove Mang Tomas All Purpose Sauce, Jufran Banana Sauce, and UFC Banana Sauce (both Regular and Hot variants) from Import Alert 99-45.\nThe US FDA alert removal means Mang Tomas, UFC and Jufran will no longer be subject to detention without physical examination (DPWE) before entering the US market.\nThe agency has since sent the same notification to its field agents across the US. "We are very happy with the approval of our petition. I am sure that our Kababayans and the American consumers who have felt the absence of their beloved Nutriasia products are very happy as well," Angie Flaminiano, Nutriasia, president and chief operations officer, said.\nThe US FDA initially issued Import Alert 99-45 in July last year, citing the use of Potassium Iodate in Nutriasia products as the reason for their inclusion on the red list. This ingredient is used to iodize salt and is the preferred ingredient for salt iodization in the Philippines to comply with the ASIN Law (Republic Act 8172), as it is better suited for humid tropical climates. \nSince the import alert, US consumers reported shortages of these favorite Nutriasia products, with the scarcity particularly noticeable during the holidays, leading to increased prices.\nIn response to the import alert, Nutriasia immediately reformulated its US-bound products. Shipments of these reformulated products resumed in August, with some products successfully cleared for sale, though others remained subject to detention. \nEarly this year, the company formally filed the petition for removal from the import alert. \nRichard Rebollido, Nutrisia senior international business manager noted, “The social media reaction, the increased prices and the speed by which supplies were depleted showed how much our consumers love our brands, and this moved us to work even harder to get our products off the red list.”\nMario Mendoza, Head of New Business Development and International Business for Nutriasia, said, “As a responsible company that adheres to the laws and regulations of every market where our products are sold and distributed, we respect the position and the processes of regulatory agencies like the US FDA.”	"\\tImages/us-fda-ends-import-restrictions-for-mang-tomas-ufc-jufran_1.png"	The US FDA lifted import restrictions on Mang Tomas, UFC, and Jufran sauces, removing them from Import Alert 99-45.

steady-philippine-economy-to-further-strengthen-peso-mufg	Steady' Philippine economy to further strengthen peso—MUFG	A "steady" Philippine economy would allow the peso to further strengthen to the ₱54:$1 level before year-end, despite lingering downside risks from local politics as well as external economic and financial developments, according to Japanese financial giant MUFG Bank Ltd.\nIn a May 27 report titled "Philippines: Steady as she goes," MUFG Global Markets Research senior currency analyst Michael Wan said he expects the Philippine peso to settle at ₱55.6 against the United States (US) dollar by the end of the second quarter, before strengthening to ₱55 versus the greenback in the third quarter, and appreciating further to ₱54.5 in the fourth quarter until the first quarter of next year.\nThis is on the back of MUFG's expectations of medium-term US dollar weakness spilling over to early 2026, Wan noted.\n"Beyond global factors, it is important to continue highlighting the Philippines' specific drivers underpinning our expectation for modest peso strength," he said, namely: manageable inflation that would lead to downward interest rates, a possible Philippine-US trade deal to lower the initial 17-percent reciprocal tariff, as well as anticipated improvements in foreign direct investment (FDI) and the government's ambitious infrastructure rollout plan.\nMUFG forecasts headline inflation to fall to an average of 1.8 percent this year—below the two- to four-percent target band of annual consumer price increases conducive to economic growth—"driven by lower domestic rice prices, good global rice supplies, manageable oil prices, coupled with lower upside risks to transport fares and electricity prices."\nFor MUFG, this would allow the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) to remain dovish and slash key interest rates by an additional 75 basis points (bps) to bring the policy rate to 4.75 percent before 2025 ends, from 5.5 percent at present.\n"We also pencil in a 100-bp reserve ratio requirement (RRR) cut in the fourth quarter of 2025, which could boost domestic liquidity by around one percent of deposit base in the Philippines' banking sector," Wan said.\n"While the timing of these forecasts is somewhat faster than what BSP Governor [Eli] Remolona [Jr.] has publicly mentioned recently (two rate cuts by 2025), we think lower inflation pressures should provide the central bank space to continue its rate cut cadence this year," he added.\nAdding to MUFG's more bullish peso outlook is the possibility of a US-Philippine agreement to lower the previously announced higher import tariff to be imposed by America on goods from the Philippines.\n"We think a deal is not difficult to be reached given the Philippines only has a very small trade deficit with the US of around $5 billion, together with low perceived indirect supply chain linkages with China in its US exports," Wan explained.\nBut Wan cautioned about "some risks on upcoming semiconductor and electronics tariffs, which could impact the Philippines."\nHowever, MUFG believes that such tariffs would "[focus] on segments that the US wants to reshore such as higher-end semiconductors and AI [artificial intelligence] chips, and as such the Philippines should still come up relatively better off," he said.\nWhile foreign investment approvals have been reported to have slowed at the start of the year, MUFG sees actual FDI inflows improving to reflect the surge in investor commitments in recent years, especially in renewable energy (RE) and sectors liberalized by laws enacted by the previous Duterte administration before it stepped down in 2022.\n"Although FDI approvals have now fallen closer to $8 billion, the key for the Philippine peso is that we should start to see some improvement in actual FDI over the next few quarters if the historical relationship between approvals and implemented capital holds," Wan noted.\n"With a relatively large current account deficit of around 3.5 percent of GDP [gross domestic product], this will be important in helping the Philippines fund its current account deficit amid rising import needs, and hence supporting the Philippine peso," he said.\nThe "Build Better More" infrastructure push, alongside stronger public-private partnerships (PPPs) with a pipeline equivalent to about 13 percent of GDP, would also "continue to support economic activity, and as such also help support economic sentiment."\nMUFG forecasts GDP growth this year to match last year's 5.7 percent, although slower than the government's more ambitious target of six to eight percent.\nFor next year, MUFG projected the economy to grow at a faster pace of six percent.\nHowever, Wan said MUFG sees the peso's relative strength against the US dollar being tempered by rising domestic political risks, as well as the threat to Philippine remittances under a pending US bill.\n"In the recent Senate elections, the candidates perceived to be aligned with Vice President Sara Duterte did much better than what polls indicated. With at least five such candidates selected in the Senate, we could see greater political noise moving forward including on an expected upcoming impeachment hearing against the Vice President," he warned.\n"Our base case is for the net impact of the recent Senate election results to result in greater political noise, while also importantly slowing the pace of reforms in the pipeline, especially more contentious ones on fiscal and tax policies," he said.\n"Nonetheless, we think it is unlikely to change the trajectory of policy including on infrastructure build-out, and as such should not materially change the country's current growth trajectory at least in the near term," he added.\nAccording to MUFG, "the upside in our view is that the risks of political instability and protests have likely somewhat diminished given a more divided Senate, but what's key for the longer term is the shape of the 2028 Presidential elections and possible contenders."\nAs for the One Big Beautiful bill in the US Congress, Wan warned that "Philippine remittances from the US could be cut by around 0.1 percent of GDP, if the 3.5-percent remittance tax proposal as incorporated in the recently passed US House tax bill is ultimately implemented."\n"Remittances from the US make up three percent of the Philippines' GDP, the highest in Asia, and this may weigh on the country's current account deficit to some extent in 2025," Wan said.\n"Of course, the band of uncertainty is reasonably wide, and among other things overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) and green card holders in the US could perhaps use informal channels to bypass these taxes. In addition, we note that historically remittances overall have been very resilient to shocks and there may also be some diversification of flows from other regions beyond the US to help offset the remittances tax," Wan added.\nMUFG also cautioned against the proposal brought forth by Remolona last week to put in place a point inflation target.\n"The timing of the possible policy change is unclear although the BSP Governor mentioned that the proposals should be done by next year. If a two-percent inflation target is ultimately implemented, it would imply a higher bar set for the BSP, and all things equal, should mean stickier and higher interest rates than would otherwise be the case," Wan explained.\n"The net impact on the Philippine peso from an FX [foreign exchange] perspective is more mixed, with higher real interest rates but at least partially offset by somewhat slower growth prospects weighing on foreign equity inflows," according to Wan.	"\\tImages/steady-philippine-economy-to-further-strengthen-pesomufg_1.png,Images/steady-philippine-economy-to-further-strengthen-pesomufg_2.png"	MUFG predicts the Philippine peso will strengthen to ₱54:$1 by year-end due to a steady economy, despite political and external risks.  Manageable inflation and potential US trade deals are contributing factors.  However, rising political risks and a potential US remittance tax pose threats.  The "Build Better More" infrastructure plan should support economic activity.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/05/28/steady-philippine-economy-to-further-strengthen-pesomufg
lower-power-costs-on-the-horizon-for-dmci-homes-residents	Lower power costs on the horizon for DMCI Homes residents	Manila Electric Company’s (Meralco) local retail electricity supplier has partnered with Conunsji-led DMCI Homes to become the first real estate firm to switch to the Retail Aggregation Program (RAP).\nIn a statement on Tuesday, June 17, MPower announced that it will onboard DMCI Homes’ properties into the Competitive Retail Electricity Market (CREM) and RAP.\nAccording to MPower, businesses with a minimum electricity demand of at least 500 kilowatts will have the freedom to select their own power provider. Meanwhile, RAP will extend the benefits of CREM to smaller consumers, such as residential buildings, by aggregating demand within the same franchise area to meet the demand threshold.\nProperties to adopt RAP are DMCI Homes’ Rosewood Pointe Condominium in Taguig City and Tivoli Garden Residences in Mandaluyong.\nOther condominium developments will be switched to CREM, namely La Verti Residences, Sheridan Towers, One Castilla Place, Flair Towers, Zinnia Towers, and Tivoli Garden Residences.\nDMCI Homes Property Management Corporation (DPMC) welcomed the recent partnership, as Arturo Zamora, vice president for purchasing, asset management, and commercial and residential leasing, said, “Our company and residents at DMCI Homes are glad to be connected with MPower as our RES. The savings on electricity bills that the households in our communities can enjoy would surely come a long way while we continue to work on our vision for building eco-friendly living spaces.”\nEnergy Regulatory Commission (ERC) Chairperson Monalisa Dimalanta, who was present during the ceremonial launch, said that this collaboration marks a significant step forward, enabling consumers to choose their own power supplier.\n“We envision a competitive energy sector that puts power quite literally in the hands of consumers, and DMCI’s switch to RAP and CREM represents a major leap forward for the power of choice in both the construction and residential industries, which we hope to inspire other developers,” she said.\nRedel M. Domingo, MPower’s first vice president and head, assured the company’s commitment to support DMCI’s growing communities through energy cost optimization and its services.\n“We remain committed to advancing customer choice across industries while\ncontributing to the country’s journey toward sustainable economic progress,” he added.\nDMCI Homes, a wholly owned subsidiary of DMCI Holdings, Inc., hopes to provide substantial benefits to more than 25,000 of its residents across Metro Manila by cutting back their power costs and securing a stable power supply.

local-sugar-output-exceeds-2-million-mt-beats-forecasts-amid-recovery	Local sugar output exceeds 2 million MT, beats forecasts amid recovery	The country’s sugar production in the current crop year has surpassed two million metric tons (MT), overcoming previous projections as the industry continues to recover from the impact of the El Niño phenomenon last year.\nAs of June 8, sugar output had already reached 2.015 million MT, with milling operations still scheduled to continue.\nIn the Philippines, the crop year for the commodity traditionally begins on Sept. 1 and ends on Aug. 31 of the following year. \nHowever, the government has since moved the end of the cropping season to Oct. 1, which is better suited to climatic conditions and cane maturity.\nThe current output marks the first time the sugar industry exceeded the two million mark since the 2020-2021 crop year.\nIt is also a substantial increase of 300,000 MT from the government’s projection of 1.84 million MT, which was earlier revised from an initial forecast of 1.78 million MT.\nIt has likewise bested the 1.85 million MT projection of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).\nThe estimate for this year was set at a more conservative level compared to the 2024 output of 1.92 million MT due to the lingering effects of last year’s El Niño.\nAgriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel said he is optimistic that if the sugar industry sustains the strong trajectory this cropping year, the Philippines could attain “self-sufficiency in a few years.”\nLaurel said there is a potential that the commodity’s output would reach 2.3 million MT on the condition that there are “the right conditions and sustained support for the industry.”\n“We’re working closely with farmers, millers, and other stakeholders to ensure that this upward trend continues,” he added.\nSRA Administrator Pablo Luis Azcona said his agency has steadily heightened its interventions on sugar canes to boost sugar production.\n“We will continue to push for more improvement with soil improvement, cane varieties, and irrigation and mechanization,” he said.\nWith the rise in sugar production, Azcona said the domestic supply will be sufficient to meet the demand, further ensuring stable retail prices of the commodity.\nMeanwhile, sugarcane prices that continue to be stable are seen to help in lowering retail prices, alongside helping farmers raise their earnings.\nBased on SRA data, the farm gate price is averaging around ₱2,700 per 50-kilogram (LKg) bag this year.	"\\tImages/local-sugar-output-exceeds-2-million-mt-beats-forecasts-amid-recovery_1.png"	Philippine sugar production surpasses 2 million MT, exceeding government and USDA projections.  This marks a significant recovery from last year's El Niño impact and a 300,000 MT increase over initial forecasts.  The positive trend could lead to self-sufficiency in a few years, with stable sugarcane prices benefitting farmers and consumers.  Continued support for the industry is crucial to maintaining this upward trajectory.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/18/local-sugar-output-exceeds-2-million-mt-beats-forecasts-amid-recovery
sec-makes-it-easier-to-raise-funds-for-property-firms-with-condotels-rental-pools	SEC makes it easier to raise funds for property firms with condotels, rental pools	The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is seeking to entice real estate companies with rental pool arrangements to tap the capital market for their growth and financing needs with the launched of streamlined rules for the registration their securities.\nRental pool agreements refer to investment contracts where a property developer sells or offers units in real estate projects such as condominiums, hotels or resorts to the public, provided that buyers contribute the units to a rental pool managed and operated by the company or a third-party operator.\nBuyers in a rental pool agreement will receive a share in profits based on agreed conditions, typically by renting out the units to third parties.\nThe Commission on May 21 introduced the guidelines on Securing & Expanding Capital in Real Estate Investment Transactions (SEC RENT) in an event titled “Navigating SEC RENT: Empowering Real Estate with Capital Market Opportunities.”\nImplemented through SEC Memorandum Circular No. 12, Series of 2024 issued on July 16, 2024, SEC RENT simplifies the registration process for securities of real estate companies engaged in selling or offering investment contracts through rental pool agreements.\n“Accounting for 5.6 percent of GDP in 2024, the real estate industry continues to be a vital engine of economic development, with strong interconnections to construction, finance, retail, and tourism,” SEC Commissioner McJill Bryant T. Fernandez said in his opening remarks.\nHe noted that, “Given its scale and strategic importance, the real estate sector stands to benefit immensely from deeper participation in the capital market.”\nUnder the program, the SEC Markets and Securities Regulation Department (MSRD) is required to complete the review of the registration statement of the covered companies within 45 days from filing, pursuant to RA No. 8799, or the Securities Regulation Code (SRC).\nPrior to submission to the MSRD, real estate companies are required to secure the approval of the SEC Company Registration and Monitoring Department (CRMD), Corporate Governance and Finance Department (CGFD), Enforcement and Investor Protection Department, Office of the General Counsel, and Office of the General Accountant (OGA) for the registration of securities for the pre-evaluation clearance.\nThe pre-evaluation clearance will then be submitted to the MSRD, together with the SEC RENT Checklist Form, SEC RENT Form and Prospectus, and all other required exhibits for pre-processing with the MSRD.\nOnce approved for processing, the application will be handed over to the MSRD, which has to complete the review of the registration statement within 45 days.\nThe launch was conducted in partnership with the Chamber of Real Estate & Builders’ Association, Inc. (CREBA), an organization with over 4,000 members including firms, individuals and associations involved in the property industry who can take advantage of SEC RENT.\nThe event also served as an avenue for CREBA members to explore other channels for capital generation, such as securitized real estate offerings, in line with the goal of the SEC to diversify financing options and encourage broader participation in the capital market.\n“We probably look at securities offering and all these types of capital market sourcing as for the big players alone. Small companies like us traditionally resort into borrowings as source of funds to continue operating our businesses,” CREBA Vice President for Housing Affairs Demetrio L. Posadas said.\nHe added that, “Our organization appreciates the efforts being extended by the SEC for now reaching out not only to big developers, but likewise for making us understand that we, small companies, probably have a chance to participate in this capital market.”\nThe event also included discussions from SEC representatives from MSRD, CRMD, CGFD, OGA and the Financial Analysis and Audit Department on the requirements under SEC RENT.

This likewise will improve occupancy from 83 percent to 88 percent and extend the weighted average lease expiry (WALE) from 7.3 to 14.6 years.\nThis will also increase FLI’s equity in FILRT from 51.06 percent to 63.27 percent.\nThe Transaction allows FILRT to diversify its income sources by integrating retail mall properties into its portfolio. Prior to the infusion, 91 percent of the GLA of FILRT is office buildings.\nPost infusion, the portfolio mix of FILRT will be 67 percent offices, six percent hospitality (Crimson Boracay lot) and 27 percent retail (Festival Main Mall).\nThe infusion of income-generating retail mall assets is expected to result in an increase in FILRT's distributable income.\nThis, in turn, translates to higher dividends per share for FILRT shareholders, enhancing the overall attractiveness of the Real Estate Investment Trust to investors. Dividend per share growth resulting from the infusion will be 5.65 percent.\nWith the anticipated growth in income and dividends, the transaction creates opportunities for improving the share price.

us-tax-proposal-may-slash-477-million-from-philippine-remittance-inflows-yearly	US tax proposal may slash $477 million from Philippine remittance inflows yearly	The proposal to tax outbound remittances of non-United States (US) nationals would slash Philippine inflows by as much as $476.5 million or over ₱26 billion per year, according to estimates from the Washington-based Center for Global Development (CGD).\nIn a May 28 blog post, CGD experts Helen Dempster, Charley Ward, and Sam Huckstep said the proposed 3.5-percent tax on remittances under the One Big Beautiful Bill—already passed by the US Lower House—would affect 40 million non-US citizens, as well as their families and friends abroad who receive money sent back home by migrants working or living in America.\n"Remittances are a crucial source of household income and economic stability for low- and middle-income countries. Indeed, for many of these countries, the impact of the remittance tax will far outweigh the impact of aid cuts," CGD noted.\n"If the new tax raises costs by 3.5 percent, that could lead to a 5.6-percent drop in remittances" from the US, CGD said, citing research that the amount remitted declines by 1.6 percent for every one-percent uptick in transfer costs.\nCGD's estimates showed that the top US remittance destinations to be most badly hit by the tax measure are Mexico, Guatemala, India, the Philippines, China, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, Vietnam, Nigeria, and Colombia.\nThis estimate took into consideration that senders would likely not only reduce the amount they send back home but also avoid remitting money altogether through formal channels like banks and money transfer service providers.\nAlso, the tax is expected to hike remittance fees when there is less demand for such services, resulting in higher costs that would ultimately redound to a reduction in cash migrants sent home.\nIn the case of the Philippines, CGD estimates showed that the remittances to be lost to the actual tax would reach $176.8 million yearly, on top of $299.7 million in losses due to the price effect.\nThe estimated $476.5 million in total reduction to annual Philippine remittances would be equivalent to 0.1 percent of the country's gross national income (GNI), or total earnings of its citizens inside the country, as measured by gross domestic product (GDP), plus those overseas.\nIn 2024, Filipinos in the US remitted to the Philippines about $14.6 billion, CGD noted, although this figure may be bloated as formal remittance channels pass money through their US offices whether sourced from America or not.\nCGD also lamented that the remittance tax proposal "would be a further crushing blow after the recent cuts to US aid."\nThe Philippines stands to lose $104 million from cuts in official development assistance (ODA) disbursed by the shuttered US Agency for International Development (USAID), CGD estimates showed.\nCGD warned that the tax "may change the way migrants send remittances" in a negative way.\nCiting a report by Spanish financial services firm Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria S.A. (BBVA), CGD said migrants could opt to avoid paying the tax by "[asking] people who have US citizenship to send money on their behalf; [using] interbank transfers rather than remittance service providers; and [using] informal remittance channels."\n"One study commissioned by the remittance service provider Western Union considered the effect of an analogous five percent tax on inward remittance flows by the Philippines, and projected that it would lead to a total decline in remittances of 9.9 percent; a decline in formal transfers of 17.7 percent; and a rise in informal transfers of 21.6 percent," CGD added.\nWhile "cheaper and quicker" informal money transfers are already around 50 percent bigger than formal channels, CGD pointed out that the former are "more subject to abuse."\nIf the intention of the tax proposal is to deter more migration to the US, CGD argued that "migrants will likely find alternative, albeit riskier, ways to send remittances home, and given, it is unlikely future migrants will be deterred."\nAs a measure to generate more revenues, "even if the tax works as intended, it will only bring in a small fraction of the roughly $150 billion in funding included in the measure for border security and immigration enforcement," CGD added.\nAs a whole, "taxing money sent to low- and lower-middle-income countries could bring in $940 million a year but could cost those countries $2.5 billion a year in total," CGD said.\nLast week, Manila Bulletin asked Governor Eli M. Remolona Jr. if the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) had already assessed the impact of this tax proposal, but he did not reply.

The 3.5% tax could lead to a 5.6% drop in remittances due to increased costs and reduced formal transfers.  This loss would equal 0.1% of the Philippines' gross national income, further impacting the country after recent US aid cuts.  Migrants may resort to riskier informal channels to avoid the tax.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/05/29/us-tax-proposal-may-slash-477-million-from-philippine-remittance-inflows-yearly

world-bank-debars-philippine-construction-firm-over-corruption-in-da-rural-development-project	World Bank debars Philippine construction firm over corruption in DA rural development project	The World Bank Group (WBG) has imposed a 4.5-year debarment on L.S.D. Construction & Supplies, a construction firm in the Philippines, for “collusive, fraudulent, and corrupt practices” linked to the Philippine rural development project (PRDP).\nIn a May 28 statement posted on its website, the Washington-based multilateral lender said that L.S.D. was involved in two undisclosed arrangements from 2017 to 2018, allowing other entities to use its name and credentials to bid on World Bank loan-funded contracts in exchange for a fee.\nThe specific World Bank-financed project is PRDP, being implemented by the Department of Agriculture (DA), aimed at boosting rural incomes and productivity in the country’s farm and fishery sectors.\nAccording to the World Bank, L.S.D. had secretly subcontracted the work to other firms that lacked the technical and financial qualifications required for the contracts.\nL.S.D. also made an improper payment to secure a contract award and to facilitate the processing of invoices during implementation—actions that violated the World Bank’s anti-corruption guidelines, the statement said.\nAs a result, L.S.D. and any companies or individuals it controls are now ineligible to participate in WBG-financed projects and operations.\nThe sanction is part of a settlement agreement in which the company acknowledged its misconduct and agreed to implement specific integrity compliance measures.\nIn recognition of L.S.D.’s cooperation and voluntary remedial actions, the World Bank said it granted a reduced debarment period.\nThe lender noted that L.S.D. has committed to developing a compliance program aligned with the WBG’s integrity compliance guidelines and to ongoing cooperation with the WBG’s integrity vice presidency.\nThe debarment also qualifies for cross-debarment by other multilateral development banks (MDBs) under a 2010 agreement on mutual enforcement of such decisions, which means L.S.D. cannot take part in projects to be rolled out through financing from the Manila-based Asian Development Bank (ADB), the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), among others.\nIn a report early this month, the World Bank said that PRDP, which started a decade ago, “remains on track in meeting the project development objective (PDO) outcome indicators.”\nSo far, PRDP helped achieve a 24-percent increase in real household income of farmers and fisherfolk beneficiaries—still short of the targeted 30 percent; a 42-percent increase in income of beneficiaries involved in enterprise development, surpassing the 30-percent target; a 111-percent increase in value of annual marketed output, which exceeded the goal of 41 percent; and 1,323,712 farmers reached with agricultural assets or services—the target is 760,000—of whom 39 percent are women, nearing the 40-percent goal, according to the World Bank.

the-future-is-oral-how-nicotine-pouches-are-disrupting-the-tobacco-market	The future is oral: How nicotine pouches are disrupting the tobacco market	As regulations tighten and public spaces become increasingly smoke-free, the tobacco industry is pivoting its strategy, investing heavily in "next-generation" nicotine products. From heated tobacco to oral pouches, the goal is to satisfy adult consumer demand for nicotine while adapting to restrictions and the social stigma of conventional smoking. In this challenging business environment, innovation is crucial for the centuries-old, multi-billion-dollar tobacco industry to remain relevant and ensure its long-term survival.\nJapan Tobacco International (JTI) has developed Nordic Spirit, a discreet, tobacco-free oral nicotine pouch. Positioned as a smoke-free alternative for adult nicotine consumers, it is part of JTI’s Reduced Risk Products (RRP) portfolio. First launched in Sweden in 2018, Nordic Spirit arrived in the Philippines in May 2023, becoming the first nicotine pouch brand in the local market.\nJTI believes Nordic Spirit has immense potential in the growing market for alternative nicotine products as the company adapts to tightening regulations and evolving consumer demands for less harmful and more discreet nicotine options.\nAt The Snus Factory in Vårgårda, the heart of production for JTI's smoke-free Nordic Spirit nicotine pouches\nDespite being a relative newcomer, Nordic Spirit is already showing promising growth in the Philippine market. Since its introduction, sales have increased by 23 percent month-on-month, according to data from major convenience stores like 7-Eleven and Uncle John's. \nA recent JTI survey of 7,000 consumers also revealed some positive reception, with 80 percent reporting a favorable experience with nicotine pouches.\nIn Vargarda, Sweden, a skilled factory worker meticulously oversees the production of JTI's Nordic Spirit nicotine pouches. This precise manufacturing process ensures the high quality of this tobacco-free oral nicotine product\nKarin Tan, JTI Philippines RRP Category Director, notes that Filipino consumers are quickly embracing the product, drawn to its convenience and satisfying nicotine delivery, which also allows for unparalleled discretion. \nBecause it is smoke-free, Tan states Nordic Spirit can be used in offices, cars, or even on flights—places where traditional smoking or vaping simply is not an option. JTI’s small, white nicotine pouch is placed discreetly between the lip and gum, allowing nicotine to be absorbed through the oral mucosa.\nThis Stockholm store sells smoke-free tobacco alternatives. Sweden's success with oral nicotine, like snus, has driven their low smoking rates, a model JTI hopes to bring to the Philippines through Nordic Spirit\nA familiar concept, a modern product\nWhile nicotine pouch consumption might seem new, it is not entirely foreign to the Philippines. For centuries, many Filipinos have engaged in "nganga," or betel nut chewing—a mixture of areca nut, slaked lime, and tobacco, all wrapped in a betel leaf. Nordic Spirit, however, is a distinct, all-white nicotine pouch that contains nicotine extracted from tobacco but without any actual tobacco leaf.\n“The growth is actually quite phenomenal, and in terms of market sales, we are growing month-on-month,” Tan shares. “That demonstrates there is traction for modern oral nicotine products in the Philippine market.” She adds, “You can see in different parts of the Philippines that consumers are starting to really appreciate what this category can bring.”\nTan also assures that JTI’s nicotine pouches are safe, as their nicotine is extracted from high-grade tobacco plants, combined with food-grade flavorings, sweeteners, and plant-based fibers. Nordic Spirit comes in several flavors, from mints to sweet and frosty berries, as well as exotic fruit blends. Unlike vapes, it also requires no maintenance.\nLearning from Sweden's success\nThe story of Nordic Spirit is rooted in Sweden's 140-year history with snus, a traditional tobacco mixture that gained popularity and spread across the Nordic region and beyond by the mid-20th century.\nToday, Sweden is praised for its progressive approach to harm reduction, boasting Europe's lowest smoking rate at nearly five percent. \nThis Swedish store highlights a thriving market for nicotine pouches, proving they're common beyond just small kiosks\nAccording to JTI, this achievement is largely attributed to the widespread adoption of oral nicotine products like snus and, more recently, nicotine pouches. \nJTI now aims to replicate this success in the Philippines, which became the first country in Asia to permit the sale of nicotine pouches under Republic Act No. 11900, passed in 2022.\nEmil Eliasson, Snus and Nicotine Pouch Lead Manager at JTI Scandinavia, explained the contemporary appeal of Nordic Spirit: "I think here in Sweden, there are increasing cigarette prices and a bit of stigmatization around smoking."\n"I would say nicotine pouches are cheaper, very discreet to use, and don't smell on your clothes or fingers. And you can use them anywhere, anytime," he adds.\nSwedish consumers use an average of eight nicotine pouches daily, with approximately 60 percent being former smokers.\nNordic Spirit is currently available in the Philippines at 7-Eleven, Uncle John’s, Lawson, The Marketplace, Lighters Galore, Food Panda, and Swebest. You can also purchase it online via Lazada and Shopee.

lopez-led-rockwell-land-bets-on-provincial-projects-to-sustain-strong-2025	Lopez-led Rockwell Land bets on provincial projects to sustain strong 2025	Rockwell Land Corporation, the upscale property development arm of the Lopez Group, is aiming to sustain its strong start for 2025 with the launch of new projects outside of Metro Manila, including several leisure residential projects and an investment hotel in Mactan.\nDuring the firm’s annual stockholders’ meeting, Rockwell Chairman and CEO Nestor J. Padilla said they will be launching in the third quarter of this year the second phase of its The Samanean at Paradise Farms in San Jose del Monte, Bulacan, which saw brisk sales after the launch of the first phase last December.\n“The overwhelming reception of our first venture in Bulacan, The Samanean at Paradise Farms, exceeded our expectations, with four clusters of residential lots selling out within weeks from its launch,” he noted.\nPadilla said they are developing Rockwell Center Lipa, their latest master-planned community in partnership with General Milling Corporation (GMC). Set to rise on this 63-hectare project are residential, commercial, and leisure hubs that complete the signature Rockwell experience.\n“This year continues the very strong momentum of our expansive horizontal projects in new, thriving cities. Lauan Ridges by Rockwell, located in Mataasnakahoy and Lipa, Batangas, has seen remarkable demand.\n“Launched just last February, the 38-hectare residential retreat is set amidst lush landscapes with stunning views of the Taal Lake. Lot buyers were drawn to its leisure-inspired character, enhanced by unique amenities such as glamping areas, nature trails and meadows,” he added.\nFor the second half of 2025, Padilla said they will launch a project in Lian, Batangas which “promises a bold redefinition of seaside living across 300 hectares, offering our market with a leisure experience unlike any other – all just a drive from Metro Manila. Anchored by beachfront residences and a golf course.”\nIn Rockwell’s flagship development in Makati City, the firm will be opening of the Proscenium Theater in the fourth quarter of this year. This 778-seater performing arts venue is set to attract an audience that values pure acoustics, intimate settings, and well-rounded experiences.\nMeanwhile, Rockwell President and COO Valerie Jane L. Soliven said “Our brand of lifestyle is also finding expression in leisure and tourism. Aruga Resort and Residences in Mactan marks our entry into this promising segment.\n“With its next phase — a full-service hotel — now in development, we are extending the Rockwell experience to travelers seeking the same standard of luxury and distinction.”\nShe explained that, “What makes Aruga unique is its investment offering: units are available for purchase with guaranteed leaseback, allowing buyers to enjoy returns while being part of a premier beachfront resort. This exciting next chapter in Mactan launches in the third quarter of 2025 — another invitation to grow with Rockwell.”\nAt the heart of Cebu City, the mixed-use IPI Center Done Rockwell will also expand with the acquisition of a 7,500 sqm property adjacent to it. The community then provides further convenience with more space for its retail component and an additional access point.

sec-bids-farewell-to-aquino-praises-era-of-digitalization-investor-protection	SEC bids farewell to Aquino, praises era of digitalization, investor protection	The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) credited outgoing Chairperson Emilio B. Aquino for championing reforms that paved the way toward a more business-friendly and innovative corporate sector and efficient capital market.\n“When I started my term, I envisioned an SEC that empowers entrepreneurs, protects investors, and makes doing business easier and simpler for the Filipino people. I am proud of what we have accomplished over the past seven years—from modernizing business registration to expanding access to capital and strengthening investor protection,” Aquino said.\nHe added that “These reforms were not just milestones. They were meaningful steps toward building a more inclusive, efficient, and trustworthy capital market. I am hopeful that the Commission will continue pushing boundaries and embracing innovation to serve the Filipino people even better.”\nThe Commission said that, following his appointment as chairperson in 2018, Aquino rolled out his SuperVision to transform the Philippine business sector (and be) considered among the best in Southeast Asia.\n“At the heart of this SuperVision is digitalization, which we see as the crucial component to improving the ease of doing business in the Philippines,” Aquino said.\nThe SEC began its digital transformation in 2021, taking advantage of the pandemic lockdown to rollout new digital tools that automated its key services such as company registration, submission of annual reports, and transaction payments.\nThe first wave of the SEC digital initiatives included the Electronic Simplified Processing of Application for Registration of Company (eSPARC), its subsystem, One Day Submission and Electronic Registration of Companies (OneSEC), the Electronic Filing and Submission Tool (eFAST), and the Electronic System for Payments to the SEC (eSPAYSEC).\nIn 2023, President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. himself joined the Commission in unveiling the second wave of digital innovations. This was followed by two more waves of digital reforms in 2024 and 2025, which further improved both business efficiency and internal processes of the SEC.\nWith the ease of registration and submission brought by these digital tools, the SEC hit record numbers in the number of new business registrations and the filing of the reportorial requirements.\nThe increased compliance rate was among the contributions of the SEC in improving access to beneficial ownership data, which ultimately helped the Philippines exit the Financial Action Task Force grey list earlier this year.\nTo further promote transparency in beneficial ownership data, the SEC recently launched the Hierarchical and Applicable Relations and Beneficial Ownership Registry (HARBOR) as part of the fourth wave of its digital initiatives.\nHARBOR is an online platform dedicated to the submission and updating of beneficial ownership information, enabling the provision of faster and more reliable data to businesses, regulators and government agencies.\n“The SEC would not have reached these milestones without our digital transformation. These tools did not only improve the services we provide, but has also strengthened our capacity to perform our mandate as the country’s corporate registrar and securities regulator,” Aquino said.\nIn 2025, the Commission also launched SEC AInnovation, an AI-enabled chatbot offering real-time, multilingual assistance on SEC regulations, available 24/7 in English, Filipino, Bisaya and other languages.\nBeyond making it easier to set up a business, Aquino championed alternative avenues to capital to help both large and small businesses thrive.\nUnder Aquino’s term, the SEC hit the target of having 888 companies tapping the capital market in time for its 88th anniversary in 2024.\nThe Commission also simplified securities registration processes for key industries, such as hospitals, agribusiness, energy, and property, to encourage broader participation in the capital market.\nIn 2024, the Commission launched the SEC Strategic Sandbox to support the pilot testing of innovative financial products.\nAquino also spearheaded the launch of new guidelines covering crypto-asset securities and crypto-asset services providers under SEC Memorandum Circular Nos. 4 and 5, Series of 2025, in support of the Commission’s goal of encouraging financial innovation while promoting investor protection.\nAquino’s term yielded significant legal victories against investment scams. In 2023, the SEC secured the conviction of those behind Kapa Community Ministry International, considered the largest investment scam in Philippine history which allegedly amassed over P50 billion from investors.\nThe Commission also intensified its campaign against illegal lending, with the SEC revoking the corporate registration of over 2,000 lending companies which have been conducting lending activities without the necessary license.\nAquino organized the SEC Capital Market Promotion and Advocacy Inter-agency Network (SEC Campaign Network) to enhance collaboration with agencies from both the private and public sectors in the fight against investment scams.\nIn 2024, the SEC launched an aggressive campaign against advance fee scams—an emerging modus operandi that preys on borrowers by collecting upfront payments for loans that are never disbursed.\nUnder his term, Aquino also positioned corporations as engines of positive change by promoting good corporate governance and sustainability.\nIn 2019, the SEC issued sustainability reporting guidelines for publicly listed companies that urged corporations to report the impacts of their business practices on the environment, with the goal of recalibrating their strategies to incorporate more sustainable practices.\nBelieving that reform starts from within, Aquino strengthened the Commission’s internal workforce during his term.\nIn 2024, the Commission earned Silver Accreditation from Investors in People (IiP) and was named one of the country’s best employers.\nThe SEC also became the first national government agency to receive PRIME-HRM Level III from the Civil Service Commission and Philippine Quality Award Level 3 from the Office of the President, affirming its commitment to organizational excellence.\nAs proof of financial transparency and good housekeeping, the SEC maintained a seven-year streak of unmodified opinions from the Commission on Audit during Aquino’s term.\nWith the many reforms he has introduced during his term, Aquino also received multiple recognitions from both local and global bodies.\nNotably, he was named the CEO of the Year during the 2022 IDC Future Enterprise Awards; the first Public Sector Innovator awardee during the 2023 Mansmith Innovation Awards; one of the Top 100 CPAs in the Philippines during the Accountancy Centenary celebration in 2023; and The Outstanding Filipino (TOFIL) award from JCI Senate Philippines in 2024.

(Job Opportunities Building Skills) program.\nSince 2024 until May 2025, SM has hosted 244 job fairs in its malls, with 8,095 employers and 149,626 job seekers participating and 20,616 hired on the spot.\nJust recently, BDO Unibank launched an accelerated hiring process for IT and cybersecurity professionals.

The program has nurtured over 4,600 graduates since its founding. In a recent alumni homecoming, 925 graduates across 27 batches shared their career journeys, with a majority now gainfully employed across various fields.\nAdditionally, 71 percent of the alumni have pursued further studies, including master’s degrees, PhDs, secondary degrees and other professional programs.\nThe SM Foundation Scholarship Program provides full tuition coverage, comprehensive enrichment activities, part-time jobs, internship placements and potential career opportunities within the SM Group.\nNational University, one of the oldest educational institutions in the country founded in 1900, was acquired by SM in 2008 and has since embarked on a long-term campus expansion strategy to make education within reach. With the expansion, NU is aiming to reach 100,000 students in 2027.\nAsia Pacific College, founded in 1991 as a partnership between SM Foundation and IBM Philippines, has been championing an industry-based curriculum that combines traditional classroom learning and hands-on experience calibrated to produce competitive IT professionals.\nAPC’s Multimedia Arts program is notable for combining technology and creativity, merging current disciplines in the creative field and the relevant knowledge of the digital creative tools currently used in the industry.\nAPC recently announced that 97.28 percent of its graduates as of 2024 have successfully secured employment after graduation.

govt-doubles-2026-coconut-planting-target-to-50-million-trees	Gov't doubles 2026 coconut planting target to 50-million trees	The Philippines is doubling its coconut planting target for next year to 50 million trees, as the government seeks to reclaim the country’s former title as the world’s top coconut producer.\nAgriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel, who heads the policymaking board of the Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA), stated that the agency is now targeting 50 million coconut seedlings for 2026, up from the original target of 25.4 million.\n“On the orders of President Marcos, we are doubling our efforts. Our new goal for 2026 is to plant 50 million new coconut trees,” said Laurel in a statement.\n“The president has allocated additional funds for this, and we will involve coconut farming communities to fast-track the production of planting materials,” he added.\nPCA initially planned to plant 100 million coconut trees by 2028 under a five-year program.\nLast year, the coconut agency aimed to plant 8.5 million seedlings but surpassed the goal by 300,000.\nThis year, the target is to plant 15.3 million seedlings.\nThe Philippines is scaling up its planting efforts to reclaim the top spot in the global coconut production, which it lost to Indonesia nearly 30 years ago. Currently, the country remains as the top coconut exporter.\nIndonesia produced 17.13 million metric tons (MT) of coconuts last year versus the 14.77 million MT of the Philippines.\nThe Department of Agriculture (DA) said the country’s decline in coconut production stemmed from the onslaught of Super Typhoon Yolanda in 2013, which wiped out an estimated 10 million trees.\nWith a budget of ₱1.8 billion next year, the reinforced planting program will also strive to boost the productivity of the existing 340 million coconut trees, the majority of which are senile.\n“The goal is to raise yields to at least 60 coconuts per tree annually through fertilization with agricultural grade salt while we wait for the new coconut trees to mature,” said Laurel.\nHe explained that the government’s planting push coincides with the rising global demand for coconut oil, which was influenced by the European Union’s (EU) move to classify palm oil as environmentally unsustainable due to high indirect land-use change.\nUnless its land-use classification is revised, the EU is set to phase out palm oil imports by 2030.\nThis is expected to open new trading opportunities for coconut-producing countries such as the Philippines.\nLikewise, global coconut oil prices are also rising due to lower copra output and surging demand for fresh coconuts as a healthy option.\nTo help farmers raise their income, part of the budget for the planting program will be used to distribute corn and coffee planting materials to coconut farmers for intercropping to help diversify their produce.	"\\tImages/govt-doubles-2026-coconut-planting-target-to-50-million-trees_1.png"	The Philippines aims to plant 50 million coconut trees in 2026, doubling its initial target to regain its top spot in global production.  President Marcos allocated additional funds, and farming communities will be involved.  The initiative seeks to boost productivity of existing trees and capitalize on rising global demand for coconut oil.  This comes as the EU plans to phase out palm oil imports by 2030.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/19/govt-doubles-2026-coconut-planting-target-to-50-million-trees

may-electricity-costs-decline-amid-higher-supply-lower-demand	May electricity costs decline amid higher supply, lower demand	The Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) announced that average generation rates charged by distribution utilities (DUs) decreased in May amid stable prices in the electricity spot market.\nPreliminary data from the ERC showed that the monthly average generation rate for the National Capital Region (NCR) dropped from ₱7.8 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) in April to ₱7.5/kWh in May.\nThe continuing decline in generation rates since 2023 results from improved general market conditions and increased supply in the system, as well as the Commission’s diligent enforcement of rules and more timely action on filings with the ERC,” ERC Chairperson Monalisa Dimalanta said.\nThe ERC attributed this downward adjustment primarily to a healthy supply margin in the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM), which supported lower system-wide average spot prices. Additionally, declining imported coal prices and a strengthening peso further contributed to the reduction in electricity costs.\nWhile several regions recorded higher generation rates in April due to the hot season, most saw relief in May. However, regions like MIMAROPA and BARMM posted a slight uptick in generation charges last month.\nAll three grids (Luzon, Visayas, Mindanao) recorded higher average supply and lower demand in May this year compared to the same period last year, resulting in lower average spot prices nationwide, the ERC noted.\nSupply in May 2024 stood at 22,218 megawatts (MW), a notable increase from 19,648 MW in May 2023. Concurrently, demand fell year-on-year, with 15,169 MW last month compared to 15,688 MW in the previous year.\nBeyond domestic market dynamics, favorable external cost drivers also helped temper electricity rates. The Indonesian coal saw its lowest monthly average price for the year at $115.8 per metric ton, coinciding with a stronger Philippine peso at ₱55.6 per US dollar.\nThese factors helped ease generation costs, alongside a slight recovery in WESM supply margin following the tight conditions observed during the peak of the dry season, the ERC added.\nDespite May's positive price drops, the ERC vowed to remain proactive in monitoring market movements to protect consumers from rising electricity costs.\nEven as we see these improvements, the ERC will not relax its proactive stance of close monitoring, particularly of global fuel prices, bilateral contracting, and market behavior, to ensure the delivery of least-cost electricity to consumers, Dimalanta concluded.	"\\tImages/may-electricity-costs-decline-amid-higher-supply-lower-demand_1.png"	May saw a decrease in average electricity generation rates due to higher supply and lower demand.  The National Capital Region experienced a drop from ₱7.8/kWh to ₱7.5/kWh.  Improved market conditions, increased supply, and declining coal prices contributed to the reduction.  The ERC remains proactive in monitoring market movements to protect consumers.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/19/may-electricity-costs-decline-amid-higher-supply-lower-demand
profile-of-pope-francis-part-2	Profile of Pope Francis Part 2	Pope Francis challenged us to rediscover the Church not as a fortress, but as a field hospital—welcoming, healing, and journeying together. With Laudato Si' and Laudate Deum, he taught us to see the earth as a common home, entrusted to our care, especially for the sake of generations to come. And with his characteristic wit and warmth, he once called our Overseas Filipino migrant workers “contrabandistas de la fe”—smugglers of the faith—reminding us that the witness of simple, faithful lives can cross borders and touch hearts where formal missionaries cannot go.\nIndeed, Pope Francis was not in some sort of “spiritual cloud” which prevented him from enjoying, with the rest of us, some simple pleasures of daily life. Very early on in his papacy, he referred to his passion for football. He was proud of his fellow Argentinian, Lionel Messi, arguably the best football player in the world today. I remember that a group of football enthusiasts who organized a football club for some high school boys had the bright idea of trying to attract the attention of Pope Francis during that 2014 trip to Leyte by ostentatiously wearing the jersey of the Argentinian national football team and the jersey of FC Barcelona, who at that time was winning one Championship after another, thanks to Lionel Messi. These football enthusiasts positioned themselves very visibly along the route that the Pope would take. Unfortunately, because of the storm that hit the island at that very moment, the Pope’s schedule had to be modified, and he could not afford to stop where the footballers were. I still have one of those shirts that the organizers gave me as memorabilia, an FC Barcelona jersey!\nThis personal experience of mine with Pope Francis reminds me of another personal encounter that a friend of mine had with the Pope more recently at a Congress he attended in Rome for social media communicators. I am referring to an article I just read in the online magazine called Omnes. In a commentary entitled “Great Job, Lolo Kiko,” theologian and author Dr. Raul Nidoy described his most recent encounter with Pope Francis last January 2025 as follows: “He was being wheeled through the central aisle of the Paul VI auditorium, people crowding towards him. A lady nearby was shouting words of thanks, and so I joined her in expressing gratitude. Next to me was a fellow pinoy who kept on repeating: “Mabuhay (Viva), Lolo Kiko!” …As a theologian, I try to base my thinking on current issues from the perspective of faith, which is basically God’s viewpoint. Faith in all the teachings of Jesus and his Church, which includes faith in God who decided to speak and govern through a pope.”\nDr. Nidoy then focused on a theme that went straight to my own deepest impression of the papacy of the late Pope. As an economist, I have always declared that the greatest failure of Philippine society, the blame for which should be shared by both the Government and the private sector, is the scandalously high rate of poverty. Among our peers in Southeast Asia, we are the only one with a double-digit poverty incidence of 23 percent of the population (and 16 percent of households). This means that close to 20 million Filipinos go to bed hungry every day. Until we address this problem and bring down our poverty incidence to the level of the 0 to 3% average of our ASEAN neighbors, it is an empty boast for us to claim that our GDP is among the fastest growing in the Indo-Pacific region today. That is why, as Dr. Nidoy observed, we should be thankful to Pope Francis for reminding us that the Church and the world is a field hospital—so many people wounded, so much suffering. Because of this realistic reading of the world today, the pontificate of Pope Francis was permeated with the theme of mercy. His motto was “Miserando atque eligendo, having mercy and choosing.”\nIt was this focus on mercy by Pope Francis that led a group of top business people in the Philippines to do something about the plight especially of poor Filipino children who suffer for the rest of their lives because they were not sufficiently nourished in their early years. Very early in the papacy of Pope Francis, the Philippine Food Bank Foundation was established to address the serious problem of the stunting of millions of Filipino children because of malnutrition and undernutrition while at the same time doing something about what Pope Francis referred to as a “throw-away” culture, referring to millions of tons of food being thrown away as surplus or soon-to-expire while tens of millions of people, especially children, suffer from hunger. The food bank also addressed another major concern of the Pope which he discussed extensively in his encyclical Laudato Si' about the harm to the physical environment done by extremes of consumerism. Surplus or excess food thrown away can damage the environment.\nAs Dr. Nidoy pointed out, however, the mercy of which Pope Francis preached should go much beyond material poverty. He enumerated the top seven accomplishments of Pope Francis as follows:\nGod is Mercy: be merciful. He helped us focus on the innermost truth of God: Mercy. And so if we want to be united to God, our only goal, then we have to be merciful to the people around us, especially sinners, the ignorant, the poor, and the needy.\nCentrality of the kerygma: God loves us, died for us, is alive and near us. This central truth of our life, he taught, is the center of all our efforts to renew our lives. Contemplating God who loves us infinitely at every moment moves us to love God and neighbor generously.\nPrimacy and infinite dignity of each person. We will truly be able to love God—a trinity of persons—and neighbor if we value each person’s dignity. Current moral deviations—like abortion, same-sex marriage, climate indifference, lack of care for sinners—are rooted in forgetting the infinite dignity of each person, each one of whom we have to serve.\nCo-responsibility of all in the Church (Synodality). Since we are all other Christs, we are all Church. We are all co-responsible for orienting our journey towards God. This thrust of Francis unleashes all the energies of Catholics to move the Church. (May I add that the Catholic laity are still a very underemployed and underestimated force in the Church. We have to overcome what can be referred to as an undesirable “clerical mentality” among some ecclesiastics who have a condescending attitude towards lay people as “mere helpers” and not at the forefront of the work of evangelizing.)\nReform of Church governance for evangelization. Curia reform and all the instruments of government so that all government is for evangelization. Since evangelization is the mission and life of the Church—the reason we exist—then the transmission of truth (doctrine) and the norms of Church governance (canon law) must be at the service of bringing people to Christ through the Gospel. To be continued.	"\\tImages/profile-of-pope-francis-part-2_1.png"	Pope Francis viewed the Church as a field hospital, emphasizing healing and journeying together.  He highlighted the earth as our common home and celebrated the faith of simple lives.  His papacy focused on mercy, addressing poverty and malnutrition, particularly among Filipino children.  The Philippine Food Bank Foundation was established to combat these issues.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/05/27/profile-of-pope-francis-part-2
mvps-mptc-open-to-toll-free-access-amid-anticipated-edsa-carmageddon	MVP's MPTC open to toll-free access amid anticipated EDSA 'Carmageddon'	As Metro Manila braces for “Carmageddon” due to the upcoming EDSA rehabilitation, Metro Pacific Tollways Corp. (MPTC) is exploring ways to help ease the expected traffic congestion.\nOn the sidelines of Manila Electric Co.’s (Meralco) annual stockholders’ meeting, Chairman Manuel V. Pangilinan said he is considering extending the free toll on MPTC’s Skyway segments, following the government’s move to waive fees on parts of Skyway stage 3 amid the so-called EDSA “rebuild.”\n"I’m glad San Miguel offered the stage 3 Skyway for free. I think we also have a connector—maybe we should do the same," he said, expressing openness to following San Miguel Corp.’s (SMC) lead.\nSMC, through its subsidiary SMC Infrastructure, operates and manages Skyway stages 1, 2, and 3. These roads span from Alabang down south of Metro Manila to Balintawak up north. MPTC, on the other hand, developed the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) connector, an alternative linking road from Caloocan City to Sta. Mesa.\n“I think we should… San Miguel has taken the lead here,” Pangilinan added, referring to waiving the toll fees in some areas encompassing Skyway stage 3, which covers certain parts of the cities of Manila, Makati, San Juan, and Quezon City.\n“It was a good lead that they’ve [SMC] done. And I think we should follow their example. To help out in the traffic situation, I guess, for the next two years or so,” he shared.\nTransportation Secretary Vince Dizon initially announced that the toll-free initiative would take effect when the EDSA rebuild project starts on June 13.\nAlthough the government has yet to specify which segments of the elevated expressway will be toll-free, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) expects this measure to offer motorists additional alternative routes during the construction period.\nMoreover, the developments in EDSA could take at least one and a half to two years to complete.\nWhile concerns over potential revenue losses remain, the DOTr has assured it is coordinating with the Toll Regulatory Board (TRB) to offset the income loss, including possibly extending SMC’s concession agreement on the 17.93-kilometer (km) Skyway stage 3.

petroleum-supply-to-samar-secured-by-doe-amid-san-juanico-bridges-limits	Petroleum supply to Samar secured by DOE amid San Juanico bridge's limits	The Department of Energy (DOE) has assured the continued supply and delivery of petroleum products, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), to Samar despite the recent weight limit imposed on the San Juanico Bridge.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, May 27, outgoing Energy Secretary Raphael P.M. Lotilla stated that the DOE has coordinated with agencies and the oil industry to develop alternative solutions to the recently implemented 3-metric ton weight restriction for vehicles crossing the San Juanico Bridge.\n“The DOE remains committed to safeguarding the energy security of Samar and its people. By working hand-in-hand with government agencies and oil industry partners, we are confident in our shared ability to rise above these challenges with unity, urgency, and purpose,” he said.\nThe weight limit would affect petroleum deliveries, which typically weigh 19 to 20 metric tons for a 10,000-liter load and often rely on the bridge for transport.\nThe energy sector addressed this logistical concern in collaboration with the Department of Transportation (DOTr), the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA), the Office of Civil Defense (OCD), and the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC).\nAccording to the DOE, the NDRRMC has approved the oil tankers in the roll-on/roll-off (RORO) vessel loading queues. The DOE also coordinated with the Petroleum Institute of the Philippines (PIP) to provide a list of fuel tanker trucks that will be transported from the port of Ormoc to the ports of Maginoo and Calbayog in Samar by Thursday.\nThrough the support of the fuel storage depot Insular Oil Corporation, petroleum deliveries from both major oil companies and independent players will be accommodated, providing an additional layer of supply security.\nThe DOE also noted that gasoline stations in Samar have a maximum maintenance storage capacity of up to two weeks and typically require refills every seven to 14 days.

philippine-economic-growth-to-stay-below-6-until-2031-world-bank	Philippine economic growth to stay below 6% until 2031—World Bank	The Philippines' annual economic growth is expected by the World Bank Group (WBG) to remain below six percent this year until 2031.\nIts newest country partnership framework (CPF) for the Philippines, covering fiscal years (FYs) 2026 to 2031, showed that the WBG forecasts Philippine gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 5.3 percent for this year, 5.4 percent for next year, and 5.5 percent for 2027—all below the more ambitious six- to eight-percent target of the Marcos Jr. administration for the second half of its term.\n"The average GDP growth forecast for 2025 to 2027 is expected at 5.4 percent. Risks are mostly tilted downside and include potential retaliation by main global players that may affect global growth further, probably hitting domestic growth," the WBG said, referring to the lingering world trade uncertainty caused by United States (US) President Donald Trump's tariff spree.\n"Increased uncertainty could trigger instability in financial markets and capital flight," it added.\nOn the flipside, "the Philippines may benefit from improved margins of preference for key export products, and from lower global commodity prices (tied to lower global growth), and absent any external pressures, the prospect of continued monetary policy rate normalization" in the next three years, the WBG said.\nThis year, its projected 5.3-percent GDP growth rate—poised to be the slowest pace of expansion since the Philippine economy gradually reopened from the most stringent Covid-19 restrictions—was attributed by the WBG to "the direct impacts of the higher tariffs and trade policy uncertainty on demand for exports, the effects of increased global policy uncertainty on investment demand, and the indirect effects on export and investment demand through lower global growth."\nBut on the upside, "these negative effects are dampened as the Philippines is mostly integrated in services rather than merchandise value chains (that have been most affected by trade policy barriers), and as public investment and private investment in non-tradables is expected to remain robust," the WBG added.\nPhilippine GDP growth is seen picking up gradually to 5.7 percent in 2028, 5.8 percent both in 2029 and 2030, and 5.9 percent in 2031.\nThe WBG forecasts headline inflation to be in the range of three to 3.2 percent from 2025 to 2031—within the targeted two- to four-percent annual consumer price increases deemed conducive to economic growth.\nAs the Marcos Jr. administration embarks on fiscal consolidation to narrow the yawning budget deficit and lower the share of public debt to the economy following massive borrowings at the height of the pandemic, the WBG projected the fiscal deficit narrowing gradually from 5.7 percent of GDP in 2024 to 5.4 percent in 2025, 4.9 percent in 2026, 4.4 percent in 2027, 4.1 percent in 2028, 3.9 percent in 2029, 3.7 percent in 2030, and 3.6 percent in 2031.\nThe national government's debt-to-GDP ratio was also expected to go down from 60.7 percent last year to 60.2 percent this year, 59.7 percent next year, 59.6 percent in 2027, 59.1 percent in 2028, 58.9 percent in 2029, 58.6 percent in 2030, and 58.1 percent in 2031.\nThe WBG has committed to "continue [supporting] domestic revenue mobilization, including assistance to the Philippines' comprehensive tax reform program (CTRP), which aims to advance fiscal consolidation through improved revenue generation and spending efficiency."	"\\tImages/philippine-economic-growth-to-stay-below-6-until-2031world-bank_1.png"	The World Bank forecasts Philippine GDP growth below 6% until 2031, with 5.3% projected for this year and gradual increases thereafter.  Risks include global trade uncertainty and potential capital flight, while benefits may come from improved export margins and lower commodity prices.

philippine-re-investments-to-slash-power-sector-emissions-by-over-18-by-2030-doe	Philippine RE investments to slash power sector emissions by over 18% by 2030—DOE	The massive scale renewable energy (RE) investments being cornered by the Philippine government will drastically reduce the carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions of the power industry by 18.34 percent around 2030, which is the timeframe when the country will hit strike on the first major milestone of its energy transition warpath, according to the Department of Energy.\nEnergy Undersecretary Rowena Cristina L. Guevara emphasized that as capacities of the green energy auction program (GEAP) winners will successively reach commercial stream, the energy sector will experience significant 10.91 percent decline in CO₂ emissions by 2026, which is considerably an early victory in the country’s climate fight; then that will accelerate beyond 18 percent by the turn of the decade.\n“GEAP has obvious implications for environmental and socioeconomic benefits. One of the clearest indicators of this is the estimated avoidance of about 80 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e) emissions over the duration of the 20-year contracts awarded under the first two rounds of GEA (green energy auction),” she expounded.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe energy official further highlighted that “the full potential of GEA 1-4 estimates 307 million tons CO₂e avoided.”\nThe first four rounds of renewable energy tenders have covered multiple technologies, and the fifth will focus on offshore wind, while GEA-6 will prioritize biomass and waste-to-energy facilities.\nThe energy official stressed, “The Philippines has pledged to reduce its GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions by 75 percent by 2030 under its NDC (nationally determined contribution) to the Paris Agreement. If GEA projects were counted, it will be equivalent to an 18.34% reduction in CO₂e emissions by 2030.”\nEssentially, 2030 marks a significant turning point in the Philippine energy transition roadmap, when renewables are expected to aggressively increase their share to a commanding 35 percent of the power mix.\nADVERTISEMENT\nGuevara qualified “the GEAP is not only a market tool for energy development, it is also a climate action mechanism that delivers measurable and impactful reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, helping steer the Philippine energy sector toward a low-carbon future.”\nThe NDC pledge that the Philippine government had previously submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) calls for a 75 percent reduction and avoidance of GHG emissions by 2030, relative to a business-as-usual scenario.\nOf the target, 72.29 percent is conditional and that shall be anchored on support funneled from the international community, including those on climate finance, technology transfer, as well as capacity building, primarily in the enforcement of adaptation measures.\nConversely, 2.71 percent of the committed CO2 emissions equivalent reduction shall be drawn from the use of domestic resources, and the country’s climate battle chips are aligned with the Philippine Development Plan, National Climate Change Action Plan, as well as long-term strategy in abating climate change risks.\nThe country’s decarbonization strategy targets a broad front, and it sets a sharp focus on energy, transport, waste, forestry, agriculture, and industrial processes. \nAhead of the 30th Conference of the Parties (COP30) that will be happening right in the heart of the Amazon in Belem, Brazil this November, the Philippines is set to submit its NDC 3.0 which will already be firmed up under the watchful leadership of newly-designated Environment Secretary Raphael Lotilla.

philippines-to-receive-400-million-adb-loan-to-boost-blue-economy	Philippines to receive $400-million ADB loan to boost blue economy	The Philippines will receive a $400-million, or about ₱23.4-billion, loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to restore marine ecosystems and strengthen its blue economy, as part of the lender’s $24-billion support package for Southeast Asia through 2028.\nADB President Masato Kanda announced at the Brunei Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA) Summit that the Manila-based multilateral bank has such upcoming multi-billion-peso loan for the Philippines.\nThis loan takes a portion of the ADB’s $24 billion support for the Southeast Asian region until 2028, or the end of the Marcos administration.\nThe ADB’s lending plan for the next three years would focus on “deepening regional cooperation and integration.”\n“This includes expanded investments to strengthen connectivity, private sector-led growth, energy integration, and food security,” the ADB said in a statement released on Wednesday, May 28.\nSuch a plan would support the region as, Kanda said, it is currently “navigating the impacts of trade and geopolitical tensions, rapid technological change, and growing threats to food and energy security.”\nHowever, Kanda argued that these setbacks also offer opportunities to firm up the region’s resilience and drive growth.\n“Our longstanding partnerships will help us turn obstacles into new pathways for progress,” Kanda said.\nTo help strengthen food systems, the ADB is raising its funding to $40 billion by 2030. In the BIMP-EAGA subregion—considered as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ (ASEAN) food basket—the ADB has poured in $500 million for agricultural development, $93 million for sustainable aquaculture, and another $500 million to tackle plastic waste in the ocean.\nThe ADB also said that it is ready to provide $10 billion in financing to support the ASEAN power grid, focusing on cross-border power links, national grid upgrades, and the expansion of renewable energy (RE) across the region.\nThe ADB refers to the “blue economy” as the sustainable use of ocean and coastal resources to drive economic growth and improve livelihoods, while protecting and nurturing marine ecosystems.

new-financial-transactions-tax-law-to-generate-over-25-billion-revenues-in-next-five-years	New financial transactions tax law to generate over ₱25-billion revenues in next five years	The newly signed Capital Markets Efficiency Promotions Act (CMEPA) is projected to generate over ₱25 billion in net revenue gains over the next five years, according to the Department of Finance (DOF).\nFinance Secretary Ralph G. Recto said CMEPA also supports the country’s medium-term fiscal program to cut the country’s fiscal deficit to around 3.8 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2028, or the end of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s term.\nCMEPA “will encourage ordinary Filipinos to invest in the Philippine capital markets,” the DOF said in a statement released on Friday, May 30.\nOne of the main features of the law is setting a uniform 20-percent tax rate on interest income to ensure fairness and prevent tax loopholes.\nIt also lowers the stock transaction tax (STT) from 0.6 percent to 0.1 percent and the documentary stamp tax (DST) on newly issued shares from one percent to 0.75 percent.\n“It also exempts from DST the original issuance, redemption, or transfer of mutual fund shares, as well as certificates or proof of participation in mutual funds or investment trust funds,” the DOF said.\n“This is a landmark reform that brings capital market investments closer to the Filipino people. By making investment channels clearer, more affordable, and more accessible, especially for small investors, we open the door to greater financial inclusion for our people,” Recto said as he welcomed the enactment of the law.\nHe added that the taxes collected “will be used to fund our priority projects in infrastructure, health, education, agriculture, and other public services.”\nSpecial Assistant to the President for Investment and Economic Affairs Frederick D. Go noted that the passage of CMEPA “sends a clear message to both domestic and global investors that the Philippines is committed to building deeper, more efficient capital markets.”\n“This reform is expected to boost and strengthen liquidity, trading activity, capital formation, and contribute to broader economic growth,” Go said.\nAside from reduced transaction costs, the DOF said that these measures are also expected to “encourage market participation and financial planning, boost market liquidity, make the country’s equities market regionally competitive, and increase capital market growth.”\nTo promote fair taxation, CMEPA sets a uniform 0.75-percent DST on bonds, debentures, and stock or debt certificates issued abroad, regardless of where they come from. This supports a neutral and consistent tax system.\nUnder CMEPA, private employers who match or exceed their employees’ contributions to personal equity and retirement accounts (PERA), as outlined in Republic Act (RA) No. 9505, can claim an additional 50-percent tax deduction on their actual contributions.\n“The law also levels the playing field among industry players as it repeals the tax exemption on pick-up trucks that are not used for livelihood purposes,” the DOF said.\nTax exemptions on passive income earned by state-owned firms are also removed, a move aimed at simplifying the tax system and increasing government revenues by applying the same tax rates as those for other businesses.\nFurther, the plan to remove the tax exemption on nonresident income from foreign currency deposit units (FCDUs) was dropped to uphold a long-standing policy that supports investor trust and financial stability.\nThe provision requiring bettors of Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) games to pay DST was also excluded to avoid discouraging participation in legal games that help fund public welfare programs.\nFinally, the Philippine Guarantee Corp.’s (PHILGUARANTEE) tax exemptions were retained to protect affordable housing loans for low-income borrowers and ensure continued government support for the housing sector.

philippines-to-borrow-785-billion-from-world-bank-in-next-two-years	Philippines to borrow $7.85 billion from World Bank in next two years	The Philippines is scheduled to borrow a total of $7.85 billion, or over ₱437 billion, from the Washington-based World Bank in the next two years under their new six-year lending program aimed at supporting the climb to upper-middle-income country (UMIC) status.\nThe country partnership framework (CPF) covering the World Bank's fiscal years (FYs) 2026 to 2031 showed that in FY 2026, which begins in July this year and ends in June next year, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) has committed to approve the following financing totaling $3.95 billion: $700-million Philippines Community Resilience Project (PAGKILOS); $600-million Project for Learning Upgrade Support and Decentralization (PLUS-D); $250-million Accelerated Water and Sanitation Project in Selected Areas (AWSPSA); $800-million Philippines Second Energy Transition and Climate Resilience development policy loan (DPL); $300-million Skills Employment Project; $500-million Social Protection for Early Intervention, Economic Inclusion and Digital Innovation (BENFIRST 2 or New Social Protection Project); and $800-million Growth and Jobs DPL Series 1.\nFor the next FY 2027, part of the $3.9-billion lending pipeline for the year are the following: $300-million Philippines Health System Resilience Project Phase 2; $400-million Philippines Government Modernization (ROTUNDA) Project; $300-million Philippine Waste and Plastic Pollution Reduction and Management Project (Clean PH MPA); $800-million Growth DPL Series 2; $400-million MSME Access to Finance for Productivity and Resilience to Climate Shocks Project (PRIME); $500-million Philippines Multisectoral Nutrition Project Additional Financing or New Project; $400-million SME COMPETE (SME Productivity, Value Chain, and Markets); and another yet-to-be-finalized $800-million DPL.\nThe IBRD is the World Bank Group's (WBG) lending arm for developing countries like the Philippines.\nAs Manila Bulletin reported earlier, the WBG plans to extend to the Philippines between $22 billion and $23 billion—or as much as over ₱1.2 trillion—in loans and other financing starting mid-2025 until mid-2031, including $18 billion from the IBRD.\nFor the remainder of the current FY 2025 ending next month, the World Bank still has four Philippine loans to greenlight: the $4-million Roads to Development for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), scheduled for board approval on June 16; the biggest-ever single loan amounting to $1 billion for the Department of Agriculture's (DA) Philippines Sustainable Agriculture Transformation Program on June 24; as well as the $240.6-million Accelerated Water and Sanitation Project in Selected Areas to be jointly implemented by the departments of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), scheduled on June 27.\nThe first two loans scheduled for approval in FY 2026 include the Department of Social Welfare and Development's (DSWD) PAGKILOS on July 28, 2025, and the Department of Education's (DepEd) PLUS-D on Sept. 26 this year.\nWhen the World Bank board approved the newest six-year indicative financing for the Philippines last May 22, its executive directors "supported the CPF's emphasis on improving human capital outcomes through better service delivery and enhanced education and health systems," the chair's summary read, adding that "they encouraged continued efforts to address child stunting and learning poverty" in the country.\nBack in 2021, the World Bank reported that the Philippines was suffering from a "silent pandemic"—childhood stunting resulting from undernutrition. Stunted children are smaller in height compared to healthier same-aged kids.\nThe World Bank was also the first to spotlight concerns about learning poverty in the Philippines, citing in a landmark 2021 report that nine out of every 10 pupils aged 10 could neither read nor understand a simple text.\nThe chair's summary added that the board of executive directors commended the WBG's focus on job creation and resilience building, while urging continued support for infrastructure, digitalization, renewable energy (RE), small and medium enterprise (SME) development, governance reforms, and public sector capacity—especially at the local level—in the CPF.\nAlso, "directors noted that the Philippines program is well positioned to implement the full mutual reliance framework with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and appreciated the bank's efforts to collaborate with development partners," it added.

philippine-exports-to-us-climb-in-april-amid-trump-tariff-threat	Philippine exports to US climb in April amid Trump tariff threat	Philippine exports to the United States (US) continued to grow, while imported goods from China slid in April—when US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on America's trading partners.\nThe latest preliminary data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) on Friday, May 30, showed that shipments of Philippine-made merchandise to the US increased by 5.9 percent year-on-year last April to $1.03 billion—the only export destination that surpassed the $1-billion mark that month.\nAs such, the US remained the Philippines' top export market during the first four months of 2025, with sales totaling $4.26 billion, up 10.6 percent year-on-year.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIt was in April when Trump, during his so-called "Liberation Day," announced a 17-percent reciprocal tariff on Philippine exports to the US.\nThese tariffs on US trading partners have since been postponed by three months, with countries like the Philippines scrambling to negotiate for a lower levy through trade concessions favorable to America.\nIn a May 29 report, Oxford Economics senior economist Callee Davis said the think tank's economists believe that it remains "uncertain" if the US' Liberation Day tariffs will be reinstated on the Philippines by July 9, although the country is among those "likely" to soon reach a trade deal with the US.\nThis is because the Philippines has offered to import more products from the US, while also not posing any threat to retaliate in response to Trump's reciprocal tariff, Davis said.\nOxford Economics economist Sheana Yue noted in a separate May 28 report that across Asia, excluding China, goods exports accelerated at the start of the second quarter, as exporters frontloaded their shipments to the US.\n"The extent of frontloading suggests this strength is unlikely to endure past the second quarter even if, as we expect, higher tariffs don't come on board after the 90-day delay," Yue said.\n"Nonetheless, increased trade barriers and uncertainty are detrimental for Asia's exports. In seasonally adjusted quarter-on-quarter terms, we anticipate the region's real exports to weaken from hereon," she added.\nThe Philippines' total merchandise exports in April grew by seven percent year-on-year to $6.75 billion, bringing four-month sales up by 9.5 percent to $26.87 billion.\nOn the other hand, the value of imported goods fell by 7.2 percent year-on-year to $10.24 billion in April, even as the first four months saw cumulative imports rise by 5.6 percent year-on-year to $42.78 billion.\nChina, the country's top source of imported products, recorded a 4.3-percent year-on-year decline in April shipments to $3.01 billion, although four-month Chinese imports remained the fastest growing, at 17.5 percent year-on-year.\nGlobally, Yue explained that Chinese exports moderated amid the threat of higher US tariffs.\nBut the Philippines' end-April imports from China, which stood at $12.05 billion, were not even close to second placer South Korea, which was the source of $3.18-billion worth. The Chinese products imported in April alone also far exceeded South Korea's $878.4 million, also in second position that month.\nImports from the US, meanwhile, dropped 17 percent year-on-year to $604.4 million in April, such that the end-April figure declined by 2.4 percent year-on-year to $2.6 billion.\nEconomists expect net importing countries like the Philippines to be flooded by imports from China as the trading giant seeks alternative markets to the US.\nThe trade-in-goods deficit stood at $15.91 billion as of end-April, smaller than the $15.99 billion recorded a year ago, as the April 2025 trade deficit narrowed by 26.1 percent to $3.49 billion from $4.73 billion in the same month last year.	"\\tImages/philippine-exports-to-us-climb-in-april-amid-trump-tariff-threat_1.png"	Philippine exports to the US increased by 5.9 percent in April 2025, reaching $1.03 billion, despite Trump's tariff threat.  The US remained the top export market for the Philippines in the first four months of 2025.  Despite the tariff threat,  Chinese imports to the Philippines declined in April. Economists expect increased trade barriers to negatively impact Asian exports.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/05/30/philippine-exports-to-us-climb-in-april-amid-trump-tariff-threat
pickup-truck-tax-reimposed-as-marcos-signs-cmepa-with-partial-vetoes	Pickup truck tax reimposed as Marcos signs CMEPA with partial vetoes	Expect pickup trucks to be more costly after the provision reimposing the excise tax on the vehicle type was approved, alongside other tax reform measures under the proposed Capital Market Efficiency Promotion Act (CMEPA).\nThe CMEPA, a legislation deemed a priority of the administration under the Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council (LEDAC), was approved by President Ferdinand “Bongbong Marcos Jr. on Thursday, May 29.\nIn a veto message addressed to House Speaker Martin Romualdez, Marcos lauded the proposed legislation as it aims to increase the government’s revenue base, contributing to fiscal sustainability with positive revenue gains.\nHowever, the President opted to veto three provisions of the bill, reportedly because they were not aligned with the administration’s policy of enhancing investor confidence, preserving fiscal prudence, and building public trust.\nThe three provisions that were vetoed include the removal of the tax exemption on nonresidents' income from their transactions with Foreign Currency Deposit Units (FCDUs), the express imposition of documentary stamp tax (DST) on bettors in authorized number games, and the repeal of the tax exemptions granted to the Philippine Guarantee Corp. (PHILGUARANTEE).\nOne of the provisions that was not vetoed, hereby receiving the full approval of Marcos, is the reimposition of the excise tax on pickup trucks.\nThe vehicle was previously granted tax exemption under the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) law during the previous Duterte administration.\nPickup trucks were given special tax treatment under the TRAIN law, as the government acknowledged their crucial role in enabling small business owners to transport goods.\nThe Department of Finance (DOF), which had previously argued for the return of the excise tax, now maintains that this basis has become invalid, as it was observed that the vehicle was being used for passenger transport and other personal needs.\nFrom the DOF’s view, the law is seen to be circumvented by this scheme, defeating the purpose of the tax exemption in the first place.\nUnder the agency’s proposal, taxes ranging from four to 50 percent will now be slapped on pickup trucks, depending on the net manufacturer's price or importer's selling price.\nThe Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines Inc. (CAMPI), the country’s leading group of vehicle manufacturers, said this will undoubtedly lead to higher prices of pickup trucks.\n“It will certainly have an impact on the price of pickup trucks,” CAMPI President Rommel Gutierrez told Manila Bulletin.\nThis view was echoed by Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. (RCBC) chief economist Michael Ricafort, who added that this would lead to lower sales in the pickup segment.\nRicafort said pickup trucks, which have become the cheaper alternative since the enactment of the TRAIN law, are now expected to have a narrower price difference with sports utility vehicles (SUVs).\nHe explained that businesses, specifically micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) that primarily use the vehicle for cargo purposes, would be the “hardest hit” by the price hike. \nWhen CMEPA was still undergoing congressional inquiry last year, the DOF said the reimposition of the excise tax would add a total of ₱30.06 billion to the government's tax collection by 2028.	"\\tImages/pickup-truck-tax-reimposed-as-marcosssigns-cmepa-with-partial-vetoes_1.png"	President Marcos signed the CMEPA, partially vetoing provisions but approving the reimposition of excise tax on pickup trucks.  This decision will increase pickup truck prices, impacting businesses and potentially lowering sales. The DOF argued the tax exemption was circumvented, as trucks were used for personal needs.  Taxes will range from 4-50 percent depending on price.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/05/30/pickup-truck-tax-reimposed-as-marcosssigns-cmepa-with-partial-vetoes
razon-led-prime-infra-acquires-60-of-first-gens-gas-business-for-50-billion	Razon-led Prime Infra acquires 60% of First Gen's gas business for ₱50 billion	Lopez-led First Gen Corporation has formally reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it will be unloading 60 percent of its gas businesses to Prime Infrastructure Capital Inc., a company owned by billionaire Enrique Razon, for ₱50 billion through the execution of a term sheet.\n“The term sheet includes the parties’ agreement to enter into one or definitive agreements for the purchase by Prime Infra of 60 percent equity stake in First Gen subsidiaries relating to its gas business,” First Gen has stipulated in its May 30, 2025 SEC filing.\nThe Lopez firm specified that “Prime Infra has agreed to pay First Gen the amount of ₱50 billion upon closing of the transaction, subject to adjustments and modification as may be agreed by the parties.”\nIn addition, the deal provided that “First Gen will be entitled to receive additional amounts, subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions.\nIt was emphasized in the First Gen regulatory filing that “the execution of the definitive agreements is subject to the negotiation by the parties.”\nWith the sale of the gas assets, First Gen will be retaining 40 percent ownership of its gas businesses, indicating that such will “assure proper continuity and stability of its gas operating plants which will in turn, greatly benefit consumers by way of more stable, predictable and lower prices, far removed from the uncertainties of spot purchases.”\nThe facilities to be covered by Razon group’s equity acquisition will be the 1,000-megawatt Santa Rita, 500MW San Lorenzo, 450MW San Gabriel, 97MW Avion as well as the planned 1,200MW Santa Maria gas-fed plants.\nOn top of the power-generating assets, Prime Infra’s purchase will also include the interim offshore liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal of First Gen.\n“The partnership between First Gen and Prime Infra will enable the partners to further nurture, enhance and expand their natural gas platforms to serve as a key solution provider to the country’s program to address energy security,” First Gen said.\nIt expounded that “the partnership will work closely with the government to help secure our country’s energy independence.”\nPrime Infra currently holds the operatorship of the Malampaya field, which is a major source of gas being fed into the First Gen plants in Batangas.\nBut given the depleting state of the Malampaya field, imported LNG has been resorted to as additional fuel source to sustain the operations of the Lopez-owned plants, while it has yet to be seen if the scheduled new drilling at Malampaya will yield additional commercially successful reserves.\nApart from its gas business portfolio, First Gen and its subsidiary Energy Development Corporation (EDC) also have heavy investments in the renewable energy (RE) sector, spanning geothermal, hydro, wind, and solar technologies.

more-government-programs-eligible-for-tax-deductible-donations	More government programs eligible for tax-deductible donations	Amid tight fiscal space for public spending, the government has tripled the number of projects included in the list of priority programs where donors from the private sector can enjoy tax deductions.\nIn a May 22 addendum, the Department of Economy, Planning, and Development (DEPDev) included 12 more projects in the 2025 National Priority Plan (NPP), adding to the original six at the start of the year.\nThe additional projects are as follows: the National Commission for Culture and the Arts' (NCCA) Support to Climate Change Action and Disaster Resilience Project: A Cultural Recovery, Resiliency and Preparedness Program (CRRP)-based Workshop for Local Communities/Local Government Units (LGUs); the Department of Energy's (DOE) Electric Vehicle (EV) Research Center; also the DOE's Accelerated Implementation of Government Energy Efficient Projects (GEEPs); the Department of Health (DOH)-Health Facility Development Bureau's (HFDB) Development of Priority Specialty Centers; as well as Accelerating Malaria Control Towards Elimination by 2030 (Movement against Malaria), a project of the DOH together with Pilipinas Shell Foundation Inc. (PSFI).\nFrom the Department of Agriculture (DA), four projects were added to this year's NPP: Project Development, Monitoring and Evaluation Activities of the National Organic Agriculture Program (NOAP); the Sugar Regulatory Administration's (SRA) Soil Rejuvenation and Fertilization of Sugarcane Farms with Low Productivity; and the National Dairy Authority's (NDA) Enterprise Assistance Through Equipment and Technology Support, as well as Milk Feeding Program.\nThe Department of Science and Technology (DOST), meanwhile, had an additional three projects in the 2025 NPP: the Science Education Institute's (SEI) Bukas Tuklas: Discovery Boxes in Science and Mathematics for Children; the Philippine Council for Health Research and Development's (PCHRD) Health Research and Development Information Network (HERDIN) On-tour; and the DOST Regional Office No. 6's Establishment of Regional and Provincial Innovation Hubs (iHubs).\nThe original 2025 NPP list included five projects from agencies attached to the DOST: the Philippine Science High School System's (PSHS) Research and Development Science Laboratories (RDSL); the SEI's Access to Resources and Innovations in Science Education (ARISE): 21st Century Learning Environment Model; the Technology Application and Promotion Institute's (TAPI) Invent School Program (ISP); as well as the Science and Technology Information Institute's (STII) Science and Technology Academic Research-Based Openly Operated KioskS (STARBOOKS), plus Continuing Operation and Broadcast of the DOST's Science and Technology Channel (DOSTv).\nThe Department of Education's (DepEd) Adopt-a-School Program (ASP) was also part of the original NPP for this year.\nA circular issued in 2009 allowed the Director-General of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA)—the forerunner of DEPDev—to add priority programs, activities, and projects to the yearly NPP "at any time during the taxable year."\nThe 18 government projects in the updated 2025 NPP are one project short of last year's total of 19.\nEvery year, the government seeks donations from the private sector for the annual NPP so it can reallocate public funds to other development initiatives.\nUnder the Tax Code, corporate and individual donors contributing to any activity, program, or project included in the NPP can fully deduct their monetary donations from their taxable income for the year the donation is made.\nDonors can claim these deductions when filing their annual income tax returns (ITRs) in the following year.\nTo qualify, DEPDev issues a certification of inclusion in the NPP, allowing donors to avail of this tax incentive.

uncertainty-over-us-tariffs-prompts-export-hesitation-logistics-firm-says	Uncertainty over US tariffs prompts export hesitation, logistics firm says	Logistics solutions provider Airspeed is projecting a 10 percent decline in its export service this year, as prospective buyers of Philippine products are holding off their orders ahead of the reimplementation of the United States’ (US) tariff policy.\nAirspeed Group President Rosemarie Rafael said the potential decline is already evident in the several blank sailings from China and the refusal to fulfill previously ordered goods in other parts of the world.\nFor instance, Rafael said there are foreign clients who are not yet open to accepting their order of furniture and garments from Cebu.\nShe said this has been going on since March, two months into US President Donald Trump’s second term, when he initially disclosed plans to hike the tariff rates of America’s trading partners.\nThe following month, Trump implemented this policy, imposing a 10 percent baseline tariff on most countries, alongside the higher reciprocal tariffs.\nThese higher taxes on foreign-made goods are currently suspended for 90 days until July.\n“I'm hoping that other economies will be able to negotiate with the US to really lower down the tariff. Because as you can see, it's not only China that's affected. But other countries that are manufacturing are also affected,” said Rafael in an interview.\nShe said the Philippines, although facing a relatively low 17 percent tariff rate, is still affected by the protectionist policy.\n“We're still on a 90-day grace period but then again, the buyers are on hold or go mood. They really don't know if they're going to push on with the orders they have or not,” the executive said.\nAs a measure to mitigate the impact of the tariffs, Airspeed is looking to strengthen its ties with members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).\nRafael said a more robust regional cooperation would provide other avenues for logistics to continue thriving.\nShe said the ASEAN could consider markets such as the Middle East and Africa, while uncertainty still looms over the US and its policies.\n“This is an opportunity in adversity wherein people can really look and see how we can build up other markets,” she noted.\nRafaela said that despite the projected slowdown in export services, she said there is a potential that this would not be realized if other markets are tapped.\nNonetheless, she said the tariffs will only affect exports, as the company’s import and domestic services are still performing well.\nAirspeed’s domestic demand accounts for 30 percent of its business, while international demand contributes 70 percent.

philippines-based-company-led-by-chinese-national-sanctioned-by-us-for-cyber-scams	Philippines-based company, led by Chinese national, sanctioned by US for cyber scams	The United States (US) Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has sanctioned Funnull Technology Inc., a Philippines-based firm, and its Chinese administrator Liu Lizhi, for facilitating massive virtual currency investment scams known as “pig butchering.”\nThese scams have led to over $200 million in losses reported by US victims alone, with an average cost of more than $150,000 per individual scammed, the US Treasury Department said in a May 29 statement.\n“Today’s action underscores our focus on disrupting the criminal enterprises, like Funnull, that enable these cyber scams and deprive Americans of their hard-earned savings. The US is strongly committed to ensuring the continued growth of a legitimate, safe, and secure digital asset ecosystem, including the use of virtual currencies and similar technologies,” Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Michael Faulkender.\nIn a separate statement, US Department of State spokesperson Tammy Bruce said that the US government “will go after those who misuse virtual currencies and internet services to perpetrate fraud and other crimes.”\n“We will continue to pursue cybercriminals who abuse the US financial sector,” the State Department added.\nFunnull provided infrastructure for scam websites by purchasing large volumes of internet protocol (IP) addresses and creating fake domains and web designs used by cybercriminals to impersonate legitimate investment platforms, said the US Treasury.\nThe company also deployed domain generation algorithms (DGAs) to help scammers quickly switch domains and avoid shutdowns.\nIn 2024, Funnull reportedly altered open-source web code to secretly redirect users from legitimate sites to online scams and gambling platforms, some of which are linked to Chinese money laundering syndicates, the US Treasury said.\nLiu, its administrator, oversaw these operations, managing internal documents and domain assignments for fraudulent use, it added.\nThe sanctions freeze all US-based assets of Funnull and Liu, and prohibit US persons from engaging with them.\nOFAC emphasized that this move targets not only scam operators but also the foreign support infrastructure that sustains their global operations.\nThe US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is working alongside OFAC and has released a cybersecurity advisory to help the private sector identify and mitigate threats tied to Funnull’s infrastructure, it said.\nAccording to the US Treasury’s website, Funnull is also known as Fang Neng CDN, with the following registered address: 3rd Avenue and 30th Street, 14th Floor, C6 Road, Purok 5, Net Cube Center, E Square Zone, Lower Bicutan, Fourth District, Taguig City, National Capital Region 1632, Philippines.\nThe address may have been a combination of two locations in Taguig City: one in Bonifacio Global City (BGC), where the building formerly known as Net Cube—now Three/NEO—is located at the corner of 3rd Avenue and 30th Street; and another in Barangay Lower Bicutan, where C6 Road passes through.\nBlockchain data platform Chainalysis noted in a May 29 blog that the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center’s (IC3) advisory specifically included the IP addresses and infrastructure used by Funnull.\n“Funnull was a central player in a network dubbed by security researchers as Triad Nexus, which includes more than 200,000 unique hostnames, many of which are associated with investment scams, fake trading apps, and suspect gambling networks,” Chainalysis said.\nAlso, “Funnull had direct exposure to Huione Pay, for which the US Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) recently issued a finding and notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) identifying it as a primary money laundering concern,” Chainalysis added.

Jobless claims and speeches from Fed officials may also influence rate expectations.\nLocally, key data includes Monday’s manufacturing PMI, Thursday’s May inflation, and Friday’s unemployment, industrial output, and consumer confidence, offering a broad view of economic health.\nPhilstocks Financial Research Manager Japhet Tantiangco said, “The local market started the week on a positive note, driven by expectations that the Philippines' inflation rate last May had remained below the government's two percent to four percent target, in turn giving the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas more room to cut their policy rate.\n"Gains were tempered, however, with concerns over US President Donald Trump's plan to double the US' steel import tariffs.”\nRizal Commercial Banking Corporation Chief Economist Michael L. Ricafort said, “The PSEi corrected higher after the passage of the CMEPA Law that reduced taxes/transaction costs of stock market transactions.”\nOther factors include the possible further easing of the inflation data that could support another 0.25 local policy rate cut as early as the next BSP rate-setting meeting on June 19, 2025; EDSA rehab suspension for 1 month; and softer local manufacturing PMI but which is still in expansion mode and that could also support possible -0.25 BSP rate cut as early as June 19, 2025.

philippine-stocks-to-take-cues-from-may-inflation-numbers	Philippine stocks to take cues from May inflation numbers	After its weak performance last week, the local stock market will now be waiting for the release of the country’s inflation data for cues as to which direction to take.\n“Next week, the local market is expected to take cues from various economic data. Primarily, investors are expected to watch out for the Philippines’ May inflation print as this would give clues on the BSP’s [Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas] policy direction,” said Philstocks Financial Research Manager Japhet Tantiangco. The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) will release the consumer price index (CPI) inflation report for May on Thursday, June 5.\nHe explained that, “A low inflation print, particularly one below the government’s two- to four-percent target may boost market sentiment as this would imply that the BSP can continue with its policy easing.”\nInvestors are also expected to look towards the S&P Global Philippines manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) and labor market data for clues on the local economy’s strength while looking out to developments on the global trade front. Tantiangco said a lack of positive developments may continue to weigh on the market.\nFor 2TradeAsia.com, the reemergence of tariff uncertainty is reordering the macro chessboard and, when paired with still-restrictive monetary conditions—especially in developed markets where central banks have less space to maneuver around this trade policy overhang—could meaningfully swing sentiment and capital flows.\nThe brokerage lamented that, “Midyear portfolio strategy is seemingly being shaped less by clear catalysts and more by an absence of them. Today’s backdrop is characterized by blurred macro signals, with disinflation underway but also decelerating (even contracting) growth across many markets.”\nIt pointed out that, “The PSEi continues to struggle sustaining momentum above 6,500—a level that has repeatedly acted as a technical ceiling in recent weeks. With crosscurrents in global trade policy and central bank posture clouding short-run conviction, a more surgical approach to positioning is suggested.\n“Favor liquidity, be selective in adding exposure, and lean into names with either fiscal tailwinds or self-funded growth. Until macro visibility improves, treat rallies as chances to recalibrate, not chase.”	"\\tImages/philippine-stocks-to-take-cues-from-may-inflation-numbers_1.png,Images/philippine-stocks-to-take-cues-from-may-inflation-numbers_2.png"	Philippine stocks await May inflation data for direction, with low inflation potentially boosting market sentiment.

peso-strength-seen-sustained-until-early-2026-mufg	Peso strength seen sustained until early 2026—MUFG	Japanese financial giant MUFG Bank Ltd. sees the peso's appreciation streak against the United States (US) dollar being sustained until early 2026.\n"We continue to forecast the Philippine peso to strengthen against the US dollar, reflecting low inflation, continued space for rate cuts, FDI [foreign direct investment] improvement, a likely trade deal with the US, coupled with strong infrastructure spending," MUFG Global Markets Research said in its latest foreign exchange outlook report for June 2025, published on Monday, June 2.\nMUFG noted that the peso's end-May spot close of ₱55.73:$1 was stronger than the prior month's ₱55.841.\nAs Manila Bulletin reported earlier, MUFG still expects the peso to settle at ₱55.6 versus the greenback by the end of the second quarter, before appreciating further to ₱55 in the third quarter, and to ₱54.5 in the fourth quarter until the first quarter of next year.\nThis MUFG projection partly "reflects global factors such as the US-China tariff pause, with our expectation now for more modest Chinese yuan weakness."\n"More importantly, domestic inflation pressures in the Philippines have also been softer than expected, and this provides the BSP [Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas] further space to cut rates to support the economy," MUFG said.\nIt had pulled down its 2025 headline inflation forecast to an average of 1.8 percent, below the government's targeted two- to four-percent range of manageable annual price increases, on the back of "continued declines in domestic rice prices, manageable oil prices, coupled with reduced risks to transport fare and electricity price hikes."\n"As such, we continue to forecast the BSP to remain dovish and cut the policy rate by a further 75 basis points (bps), bringing it to 4.75 percent by end-2025" from the current 5.5 percent, it said.\nAs MUFG noted in its previous May 27 report, the Philippines would likely benefit from a possible trade pact with America to lower US President Donald Trump's initial 17-percent reciprocal tariff on Philippine imports.\nBut MUFG still flagged three downside risks to the peso: the 3.5-percent remittance tax on non-US nationals under the pending One Big Beautiful bill—already passed by the US Lower House—which could cut Philippine inflows by 0.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP); slowing FDI approvals; as well as rising local political risks seen spilling over until next year.\n"Our base case is for the recent Senate election results to slow the pace of reforms but we think it is unlikely to change the trajectory of policy including on infrastructure build-out," MUFG said, referring to the underperformance of the Marcos Jr. administration's Alyansa bets and the entry of more-than-expected senators aligned with Vice President Sara Duterte into the upper chamber in the upcoming 20th Congress.	"\\tImages/peso-strength-seen-sustained-until-early-2026mufg_1.png,Images/peso-strength-seen-sustained-until-early-2026mufg_2.png"	MUFG Bank forecasts the Philippine peso to strengthen against the US dollar until early 2026, citing low inflation, potential rate cuts, and FDI improvement.  The projection anticipates the peso reaching ₱54.5 by the first quarter of 2026.  However, risks include a potential 3.5% remittance tax and slowing FDI approvals.  MUFG expects the BSP to cut the policy rate further.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/03/peso-strength-seen-sustained-until-early-2026mufg
upholding-the-manigsaca-legacy-the-familys-continuing-success-in-the-hospitality-industry	Upholding the Manigsaca legacy: The family's continuing success in the hospitality industry	Samantha Manigsaca\n From a small business venture to cementing a trustworthy name in the business landscape, Ray and Venus Manigsaca started their legacy in Cebu City. Initially focused on general construction, the couple saw potential in real estate by the mid-2000s. Using profits from their first business, they began developing properties, eventually leading to the establishment of AppleOne Properties Inc. The company has received multiple accolades and various recognitions from prestigious award-giving bodies in both the local and international scene, proving its commitment to delivering excellence and innovation in the industry.\nDriving the company’s success are the diligent and relentless members of the Manigsaca family—among them, Samantha, the vice president for hospitality and a second-generation leader of the AppleOne Group. In an interview, Samantha shared that while it’s common in Filipino families for children to follow in their parent’s footsteps, she takes pride that her parents never pressured her into joining the hospitality industry. Instead, her involvement stemmed from a genuine passion she had nurtured since she was younger.\n“Hospitality has always been natural to me. I always like to be with people, I always like to serve people, clean the house, — it’s about people facing and creating experiences for guests — and that’s what I have always wanted to be passionate about,” Samantha stated.\nBefore joining the family business, Samantha gained valuable experience working with renowned international hotel brands such as Sheraton Cebu Mactan Resort, The Ritz-Carlton Hong Kong, JW Marriott Hong Kong, Marriott Hotel Manila, and The Westin Manila.The best practices she gained from these institutions now guide her leadership style . Samantha was driven by a strong sense of responsibility and the desire to support her parents in growing the company. Conversations with her family, exposure to her parents’ decision-making, , and guidance from industry mentors gave Samantha the confidence to embrace a leadership role. Today she leads AppleOne Group’s hospitality arm, overseeing site selection for future projects and forging key partnerships with global hotel brands.\nCarrying forward the legacy while powering progress\nThe Manigsaca mark has left a strong and lasting legacy in the industry, one that Samantha deeply values. She saw the continuous growth in Visayas and Mindanao and acknowledges that it is what keeps her motivated and driven to continue the work she does. She also recognized the importance of having fresh eyes and new perspectives in order to keep up with the evolving business landscape, where she and her older brother Patrick come in.\nSamantha believes the family legacy remains steadfast because their parents remain actively involved in the business. After her job overseas, she returned to ensure that the values and vision Ray and Venus Manigsaca built would continue seamlessly, for more generations to come.\n“There’s a lot of respect and responsibility on my part when it comes to valuing and supporting what my parents have built. Growing up, it was instilled in us that this is how we do business, this is how we navigate things,” she shared. “My brother and I came into the business earlier than expected because we wanted to contribute with fresh eyes while honoring the legacy.”\nSamantha also emphasized how the family’s core values continue to shape AppleOne’s identity and long-term vision. “It matters to us that all four of us are present in AppleOne. We’ve always seen it as a family business and that extends to our people. We are not here without our employees,” she said. “My parents may be the brains of it, but we can’t do it all without the heart they bring.”\nSamantha also upholds the idea of honoring one’s word and valuing relationships with others—not only because they help move the business forward, but because they reflect the integrity and trust that define her family's legacy.\nA new generation of leadership\nComing from outside the family business, Samantha brings a fresh perspective and a sharp understanding of market needs in the hospitality industry—contributions that have been instrumental in driving the company’s growth. Her focus is on advancing AppleOne’s growth and positioning while remaining true to the family’s legacy of creating better living communities.\n“My leadership style is rooted in the values and traditions my parents instilled in us. As a second-generation leader, innovation and fresh perspectives are essential to staying ahead in today’s competitive market; especially here in Cebu and in VisMin,” Samantha said.\nThe younger Manigsaca is also persistent not only in giving the best for the company but also in learning and navigating the evolving challenges of the hospitality industry. Despite the pressure that comes with her role, Samantha embraces each challenge as an inspiration and an opportunity for personal and professional growth. Under her leadership, AppleOne has adopted new approaches and strategies aimed at strengthening the business and unlocking its full potential—clearly reflected in recent mixed-use developments that combine hotel and residential concepts, such as the Sheraton Cebu Mactan Resort, JW Marriott Panglao Island Resort & Residences in Bohol, and Radisson Blu Hotel & Residences in Cagayan de Oro.\nSheraton Cebu Mactan Resort\n     Aside from providing high-quality properties and delivering outstanding customer experiences, Samantha shared that AppleOne prioritizes meeting community needs, which is why they are focused on growing their portfolio especially in the hospitality arm.\n“We are focused on the three projects now that are set to open in the next couple of years, but we see a lot of potential in hospitality, especially in the hotel and resort aspect of the industry.We plan to grow our portfolio and explore new opportunities moving forward. ,” Samantha discussed.\nMahi Center in Lapu-Lapu, Cebu\n  Fairfield by Marriot Cebu Mactan in Mahi Center\n The Manigsaca mark is not only a reputable and remarkable name in the business scene but also a legacy that empowers the communities around them by providing local employment opportunities and supporting economic development, with Samantha’s personal vision and dedication propelling these efforts forward.\n“Looking ahead, I’m really excited by the possibilities. Every chance we get to create new opportunities for others is a step toward something bigger; a thriving, interconnected family for everyone,” she said.\n“For us, it’s not just about where we are today, but about what we can unlock together for tomorrow. We’re committed not only to meeting their current needs but also to investing in sustainable growth and building a better future together.”\nSamantha’s passion for helping those around her and her commitment to preserving the family’s legacy are more than enough to keep the company moving forward with purpose and resilience. Her leadership reflects the blend of tradition and innovation—rooted in family values, yet open to new possibilities.

world-bank-retains-53-growth-forecast-for-2025-amid-uncertainties	World Bank retains 5.3% growth forecast for 2025 amid uncertainties	Washington-based World Bank has retained its below-target 5.3 percent growth forecast for the Philippines in 2025 as heightened policy uncertainties and softer business and consumer confidence continue to weigh on investment, exports, and consumption across the region, including the Philippines.\nBased on the multilateral lender’s latest issue of global economic prospects published in June, growth in the East Asia and the Pacific (EAP) is seen to decelerate to 4.5 percent this year from five percent in 2024.\nFor the Philippines, the World Bank has projected annual economic growth to remain below six percent until 2027.\nAmong the cited reasons for these forecasts are the “direct effects of higher trade barriers and the indirect effects of heightened policy uncertainty, a weaker global growth outlook, and softer confidence.”\nThe report stated that these factors “weigh on investment, exports, and consumption in the region,” noting that EAP economies are “more exposed to trade policy shifts due to their high trade openness.”\nIn its April report, the World Bank forecasted that the Philippine gross domestic product (GDP) would expand by only 5.3 percent this year, before increasing to 5.4 percent next year.\nIf the World Bank’s latest projections for the Philippines materialize, they would be the lowest growth rates since 2021, when the economy recovered after gradually reopening from the most stringent Covid-19 lockdowns that dragged the country to its worst post-war recession in 2020.\nIn its latest country partnership framework (CPF) for the Philippines, the World Bank Group (WBG) has projected the country’s GDP to gradually rise to 5.7 percent in 2028, 5.8 percent in both 2029 and 2030, and 5.9 percent by 2031.\nStill, all these expansion rates would fall below six percent. The government is targeting more ambitious six-to-eight-percent annual economic growth for the next two years.\nIn the first quarter of the year, the GDP expanded modestly 5.4 percent, slightly faster than the 5.3 percent in the previous quarter, but lower than the 5.7 percent in the same period in 2024. It also fell significantly short of the government’s six percent growth target to eight percent.\nA month ago, the national government earlier said the economy remains strong, asserting that its first-quarter growth, though not fully meeting expectations, still ranked among the fastest in Asia.\nEarly data showed the Philippines tied with China as the second fastest-growing economy in Asia, behind Vietnam’s 6.9 percent, and ahead of Indonesia (4.9 percent), Malaysia (4.4 percent), and Thailand (2.8 percent projected).

philippines-secures-16-billion-loan-from-france-for-climate-action	Philippines secures ₱16-billion loan from France for climate action	The Philippine government has secured concessionary funding worth € 250 million, or approximately ₱15.8 billion, from France to enhance the country’s climate actions through a subprogram of the previous action plan.\nAccording to a Department of Finance (DOF) statement released on Monday, June 2, the funding will be provided by the Agence Française de Développement (AFD). The bilateral deal was formalized between Finance Secretary Ralph G. Recto and France’s Ambassador Marie Fontanel.\nIn particular, the financing will be allocated for the Climate Change Action Plan, Subprogram 2 (CCAP2), which builds upon CCAP1. This project aims to help vulnerable sectors in the transition to a resilient, low-carbon economy.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe CCAP2 program is jointly funded by the Manila-based Asian Development Bank (ADB), which is contributing 449.1 million euros, and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), which is providing JPY 35 billion in partnership with AFD.\nThe CCAP is made up of three subprograms that back climate-related policy reforms in areas including improving climate action planning, financing, and institutional coordination; boosting resilience to climate change impacts; and promoting low-carbon development.\nCCAP1 was implemented from January 2020 to March 2022, with funding support of $250 million from the ADB and € 150 million from the AFD.\n“With this agreement, we strengthen our strategic cooperation on climate action, reinforce our institutional capacities, and accelerate the delivery of real, lasting change—especially for the most vulnerable,” Recto said during the event.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFontanel said that both countries “stand once again united in their commitment to address the urgent challenges of climate change, environmental degradation, and ocean protection.”\n“As a development partner, we are proud to be a part of this effort and to be working at the policy level. We firmly believe that working on systemic change is essential to meet the scale and urgency of today’s climate challenges,” AFD country director Benedicte Gazon said.\nRecto assured the French government of the Marcos administration’s commitment to implementing the program “with urgency and integrity.”\n“We will ensure that every euro invested, and every collaboration, will translate to meaningful impact in the lives of ordinary Filipinos,” Recto said.\nAFD is a public financial institution that carries out France’s official development policy, focusing on reducing poverty and promoting sustainable development.

offshore-wind-port-plans-hit-snags-budget-woes-unstable-ground-delay-studies	Offshore wind port plans hit snags: Budget woes, unstable ground delay studies	The ongoing study of the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) on at least three regional port facilities that will serve as support infrastructure to the emerging offshore wind industry in the power sector had hit chokepoints, including budget constraints for two of them; while the plug had been pulled on the other one due to shaky geotechnical foundation.\nThe update on the ports study was directly shared with relevant industry stakeholders by Energy Undersecretary Giovanni Carlo J. Bacordo in this year’s Wind Energy Forum, convened by the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC), Danish engineering firm NIRAS, as well as other partners.\nIn particular, the energy official disclosed that “in Camarines Norte, the original site identified in Jose Panganiban was dropped due to poor soil conditions that rendered it unsuitable for offshore wind-related infrastructure.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nFollowing the preliminary outcome of the PPA study, he specified that the focus had shifted to another targeted site in Pambuhan, located in the town of Mercedes in the province, with the hope that the planned port support facility in that area could be established on solid and stable load-bearing ground.\nFor the port of Currimao in Ilocos Norte, Bacordo emphasized that the proposed port re-purposing is “currently awaiting a revised development proposal,” as he noted that “the initial plan exceeded the available budget.”\nHe further qualified that “adjustments are being made to align the scope with funding constraints.”\nMeanwhile, for the other prospective offshore wind port in Batangas, the DOE official likewise stated that “the proposed redevelopment exceeded the initial budget allocation.”\nBacordo expounded that “a scaled-down version has been requested to ensure implementation within the approved funding.” \nBeyond that, he conveyed that “a feasibility study is ongoing to assess (Batangas) port’s potential as a long-term offshore wind hub” – and the game plan is to concretize that via a public-private partnership (PPP) model.\nDespite the roadblocks confronting the port studies, the energy official assured that the Department of Transportation (DOTr), as a parent agency of the PPA, “is reaffirming its support for offshore wind development,” and that comes with the enabling support of the Asian Development Bank’s (ADB’s) Infrastructure Preparation and Innovation Facility.\nBacordo further divulged that through DOE’s collaboration with the transportation department, two ports will likewise be developed to underpin the advancement of offshore investments in the country – and these are the targeted installations in Southern Mindoro and another one in Negros Oriental.\nOn the timeline of the targeted retrofit for the ports, he highlighted that at least three PPA ports shall be ready by 2027; and the two DOTr ports must be ramped up commercially by 2030 – and these shall be synchronized for a solid two-year use by offshore wind developers during the construction phase of their projects.\nHe underscored, though, that these port installations are still at ‘indicative phases’; entailing then that plans could still change depending on the technical feasibility as well as fiscal soundness of the proposed facilities.\n“We need the private port owners, port developers, and port operators to help the government in the realization of our OSW projections,” Bacordo stressed.\nHe similarly pointed out that to solidify the implementation of the targeted facilities, “we need to expand partnerships. We need private port owners and manufacturers to explore synergies with the government and OSW developers to create a vibrant investment ecosystem.”	"\\tImages/offshore-wind-port-plans-hit-snags-budget-woes-unstable-ground-delay-studies_1.png"	Philippine Ports Authority's (PPA) study on offshore wind port facilities faces budget issues and unstable ground.

(PERC) announced that the Northern Luzon offshore wind (OSW) in Ilocos Norte has been granted a pre-development environmental compliance certificate (ECC) from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).\nIn a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) on Monday, June 2, the company said Buhawind Energy Northern Luzon Corp. (BENLC) has been awarded an ECC, which would allow them to conduct geophysical, geotechnical, environmental, and social surveys that would help study the physical and social conditions of the development site. \nThis would also further move the about two-gigawatt (GW) OSW project to construction, if deemed feasible.\n“These data will be needed not only in the development design of the OSW power facility but also in assessing potential environmental impacts to the site,” it stated.\nBENLC is a joint venture of PetroGreen Energy Corp. (PGEC), along with Danish firm Copenhagen Energy (CE).\nYrel Ventura, PGEC’s assistant vice president for environment and community, elaborated that the ECC approval would “initiate the conduct of a systematic, comprehensive, and scientific study of the site’s physical and social setting that will not only meet international industry standards but provide a factual basis for assessing development concerns.”\nPreviously, the Northern Luzon OSW earned the energy project of national significance (EPNS) certification from the DOE last April, allowing the expedited processing of its developments. The Board of Investments (BOI) has also endorsed the project through a green lane certification last November.\nAside from Northern Luzon, BENLC is planning other wind farms that would generate a total capacity of four GW, including the Northern Luzon OSW.\nThis includes the Northern Mindoro and East Panay wind projects.\nIts international partner, CE, has significant experience in developing offshore and onshore wind projects, as well as solar plants located in Denmark, Ireland, Italy, and Australia.

philippine-manufacturing-growth-sluggish-in-may-as-foreign-orders-wane-jobs-decline	Philippine manufacturing growth sluggish in May as foreign orders wane, jobs decline	Following the pickup in manufacturing in April, Philippine factory growth in May slowed to an almost stagnant pace as production declined due to waning demand for new orders from foreign markets and the sharpest drop in employment in the sector in nearly a year.\nData from S&P Global revealed that the month of May posted “a broadly stagnating picture in the Filipino manufacturing sector,” which showed a “setback to growth momentum built in April.” Growth in April was a sharp rebound from the nearly four-year low seen in March.\n“After April marked a solid revival in the health of the Filipino manufacturing sector, the latest data signaled a notable reversal,” S&P Global said in its latest purchasing managers’ index (PMI) report, released Monday, June 2.\nAccording to the report, the Philippines’ PMI—an overall single-figure indicator of how the manufacturing sector is performing—fell to 50.1 in May from 53 in the previous month. The report said this signals “a broad stagnation in operating conditions.”\n“Output fell into contraction territory while new order growth waned, with the downturn in demand from foreign markets also weighing on total new sales,” it said, noting that this came after steady export sales in the two previous months.\nIt said that the rate of contraction was “fractional,” but it was notably the strongest in six months, or since November last year.\nThe decline in production came alongside a fresh drip in employment as manufacturing companies often delayed hiring replacements after workers resigned. “The rate of job shedding was marginal, but the strongest in nearly a year,” S&P Global noted.\nThe report cited the lack of workers as a major factor behind the renewed rise in unfinished work among producers in the country.\nMaryam Baluch, economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said that “while new orders continued to increase, they did so at a slower pace, overshadowed by contractions in other areas.” These areas were output, employment, and the inventories of both purchases and finished goods.\nBaluch further said that this situation was “further exacerbated by a deteriorating demand from foreign markets, with May witnessing a sharper drop in new export orders.”\n“As global trade tensions escalate, the outlook for overseas demand appears increasingly precarious,” the economist noted.\nOn the other hand, Baluch said that the modest rise in consumer prices this year could support the demand in the next few months. Softer inflation could also provide “a necessary buffer against the challenges posed by a cooldown in new orders and external market uncertainties.”	"\\tImages/philippine-manufacturing-growth-sluggish-in-may-as-foreign-orders-wane-jobs-decline_1.png"	Philippine manufacturing growth slowed significantly in May, showing a near-stagnant pace due to weakening foreign demand and a sharp employment drop.  The PMI fell to 50.1 from 53, signaling a broad stagnation in operating conditions. Output contracted, and new order growth waned, particularly from foreign markets.

peza-investment-approvals-slow-down-as-tariff-threat-casts-uncertainties	PEZA investment approvals slow down as tariff threat casts uncertainties	Year-to-date investments approved by the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) continue to trend upward compared to the previous year, but uncertainties stemming from the United States' (US) tariff policy are dampening foreign investor interest.\nIn a statement, PEZA said it has approved ₱66.34 billion in investment pledges from January to May, 80-percent higher than the ₱36.83 billion recorded in the same period last year.\nThe pledges, which translate to actual investments over time, cover 102 new and expansion projects. These are projected to create approximately 29,000 jobs and generate over $1 billion in export revenues.\nPEZA said its strong performance this year is a testament to the growing investor confidence in the country’s economic zones.\nFrom January to February, the investment promotion agency (IPA) approved ₱52.93 billion worth of investment pledges, jumping 338 percent from ₱12.1 billion during the first two months of 2024.\nIn March, when talks of new tariffs intensified under the Trump administration in the US, approvals eased to ₱6.01 billion—which was still better than the ₱2.86 billion in the same month last year.\nFor April, however, the IPA only approved ₱4.58 billion in investment pledges, a sharp 69-percent drop from the ₱15 billion last year.\nDuring the month, US President Donald Trump announced a sweeping baseline 10-percent tariff on all foreign-based goods coming into America.\nTrump also imposed higher reciprocal tariffs on the majority of its trading partners, with the Philippines facing a 17-percent tax. This was then postponed until July.\nPEZA did not specify the exact number of approvals in May, but based on the accumulated investments since January, it recorded approximately ₱2.82 billion. This would be a 59-percent decline from the₱6.87 billion in the same month in 2024.\n“There still remains some uncertainty regarding the US tariffs which are currently being negotiated,” said PEZA Director General Tereso Panga.\nTo improve investor confidence amid shifting global policies, Panga said the IPA is looking to capture the growing interest of Chinese companies in the Philippines under the China plus one (C+1) scheme.\n“PEZA has received numerous amounts of inquiries lately and we are confident that we can do a quick turn-over and welcome these companies as new locators” he said.\nThe C+1 strategy emerged during the trade dispute between China and the US during the first Trump administration, where companies diversified their supply chain and manufacturing activities away from China and into new markets to mitigate risks.\nWith both countries engaging in another heated dispute, PEZA sees potential benefits for the country to garner more investments.\nAccording to PEZA, South Korea is the leading source of investment commitments so far this year, accounting for 16.12 percent of the total approved investments. The recently implemented South Korea-Philippines free trade agreement (FTA) was cited as the major contributor to the strong contribution.\nOther major sources of investment include the US, China, Japan, and the Netherlands.\nPanga said the agency is in talks with Malaysian and Indonesian companies that have earlier signaled their interest in establishing their foothold in the country.\n“We welcome these interests as we continue to grow and strengthen inter trade ties among our neighbors, making the ASEAN [Association of Southeast Asia Nations] region a more cohesive economic and trade area,” he said.\nOn the industry front, the manufacturing sector topped the list of investment pledges by the end of May with 41 investment commitments, followed by the information technology and business process management (IT-BPM) sector with 32 pledges.\nCalabarzon region—comprising the provinces of Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and Quezon—remains as the top investment destination thus far this year, notching 50 investments.\nCentral Visayas followed suit with 16 investments, edging Metro Manila with 14 pledges.\nDespite the sluggish growth in investment approvals due to the tariff threat, PEZA remains on track to reach its growth target for this year.\nThe IPA earlier set its target to boost investment approvals by nine to 10 percent in 2025.\nIt approved ₱214.18 billion worth of investments in 2024, a 22-percent increase from the previous year’s ₱175.7 billion.

April approvals sharply dropped 69% from 2024 due to new tariffs, while May showed a 59% decline.  PEZA is seeking investment from Chinese companies under the C+1 scheme and remains on track to meet its growth target. South Korea is the leading investor this year, boosted by a recent FTA.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/03/peza-investment-approvals-slow-down-as-tariff-threat-casts-uncertainties
philippines-canada-take-helm-of-oecd-southeast-asia-program	Philippines, Canada take helm of OECD Southeast Asia program	The Philippines and Canada have officially assumed co-chairmanship of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (OECD) Southeast Asia Regional Program (SEARP), succeeding Vietnam and Australia during the OECD ministerial council meeting held in Paris, France.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, June 3, the OECD said the program has served as a vital platform for connecting OECD member countries with Southeast Asia—an economic powerhouse with a combined gross domestic product (GDP) exceeding $3 trillion—since its launch in 2014.\n“The economic dynamism of Southeast Asia makes the region a center for global growth and supply chains,” said OECD secretary-general Mathias Cormann, highlighting continued efforts to deepen engagement through the OECD strategic framework for the Indo-Pacific and its implementation plan.\n“Our work with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on regional economic co-operation and integration, and tailored support for countries on aligning with OECD standards and best practices, aim to help the region unlock its full potential,” Cormann said.\nFor over a decade now, “Southeast Asian countries have more than doubled their adherence to OECD instruments and their participation in OECD bodies” as well as completed 67 legal adherences to OECD instruments, it said.\nEarlier this year, the Philippines also signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the OECD, pledging enhanced cooperation on macroeconomic policy, infrastructure, and corporate governance, it noted.\nBoth the Philippines and Singapore recently joined the OECD’s inclusive forum on carbon mitigation approaches (IFCMA), further deepening regional collaboration on climate action, it added.\nThe region’s relationship with the OECD entered a new chapter in 2024, with accession discussions launched for Thailand and Indonesia, aimed at catalyzing domestic reforms and supporting their goal of achieving high-income status, the statement said.

philippine-growth-to-slow-further-in-2025-missing-govt-target-for-third-year-oecd-report	Philippine growth to slow further in 2025, missing gov't target for third year—OECD report	After a disappointing 5.7-percent gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate last year, the Philippines is expected to post an even slower growth rate of 5.6 percent for 2025, which would once again fail to reach the government’s growth target of six to eight percent.\nGrowth would only accelerate at a six-percent rate by 2026, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) revealed in its report, published on June 3, titled “OECD Economic Outlook, Volume 2025 Issue 1: Philippines: Tackling Uncertainty, Reviving Growth.”\nTo recall, the country missed its economic target for the second year in a row in 2024, following a 5.5-percent expansion in 2023—short of the six- to seven-percent goal. Growth exceeded the target ceiling in 2022, at 7.6 percent.\nOECD pointed to a potential “larger-than-expected slowdown in major economies, including the United States (US) or China” as a development that could “reduce demand for Philippine exports and affect remittance inflows, impacting domestic consumption and investment.”\nExports of local goods and services are projected to expand by 5.5 percent by year-end, faster than the 3.3 percent in 2024. However, OECD has also forecast that this would eventually slow at 2.1 percent, even slower than the previous year.\nIn turn, the trade deficit is expected to ease slightly as net exports are now projected to decline by 1.2 percent, a slower drop compared to the projected 1.3 percent in 2025.\nThe Department of Economy, Planning, and Development (DEPDev) had said earlier that the 19.8-percent contraction in net exports has a massive impact on the country’s lackluster first-quarter performance. The economy grew by a lower-than-expected 5.4-percent rate.\nMeanwhile, OECD has projected consumer spending to grow from 4.9 percent in 2024 to 5.7 percent in 2025, and even faster at 6.5 percent in 2026.\n“On the upside, recent reforms to reduce barriers to foreign direct investment (FDI) could boost investment,” OECD noted.\nTotal real investment, which measures the volume of gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) across the economy, is seen to expand by three percent in 2025, just more than half its pace in 2024. But this is expected to rebound in 2026, similar to the movement in 2024.\nThe projected recovery of investment in the first half of 2025 could be attributed to the decline in borrowing costs. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) recently decided to trim the key borrowing cost by a quarter point to 5.5 percent, and the market expects further cuts in the coming months.\nOECD noted, however, that the “recent escalation of global trade tensions is expected to weigh on external demand and export revenues.”\nFor a holistic economic growth, OECD suggested that local policymakers should continue improving reforms that encourage competition.\nIt cited the amended Public Services Act (PSA) that “reduced barriers to foreign investment in services.”\n“Further streamlining regulations across key network sectors, such as energy, telecommunications and transport, can reduce barriers to entry and encourage private investment,” it added.\nOECD stressed that tackling labor market issues is a major move to raising productivity and giving workers more stability. This involves lowering non-wage labor costs and making labor rules more flexible, which could encourage businesses to offer more formal jobs.\n“Enhancing women’s participation in the labor force through improved access to affordable childcare and flexible work arrangements would enable the Philippines to leverage its substantial human capital, thereby fostering economic growth and reducing gender disparities in employment,” the report further said.	"\\tImages/philippine-growth-to-slow-further-in-2025-missing-govt-target-for-third-yearoecd-report_1.png,Images/philippine-growth-to-slow-further-in-2025-missing-govt-target-for-third-yearoecd-report_2.png"	The Philippines' GDP growth is projected to slow to 5.6 percent in 2025, missing the government's target for the third consecutive year.  The OECD cites a potential slowdown in major economies as a contributing factor, impacting exports and remittances.  Consumer spending is expected to increase, and reforms aimed at boosting investment are underway.  However, global trade tensions are anticipated to negatively affect external demand and export revenues.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/04/philippine-growth-to-slow-further-in-2025-missing-govt-target-for-third-yearoecd-report
prioritizing-the-economy-refocus-reform-rebuild	Prioritizing the economy: Refocus, reform, rebuild	As the dust settles from the 2025 midterm elections, I find myself reflecting on what truly matters as we enter a new chapter in our national legislature. While politics continues to dominate the headlines, it's our economy—our ability to attract investments, support small businesses, and create sustainable jobs—that demands urgent, undivided attention.\nFor years, I've seen the business community raise the same concerns, yet they continue to be overlooked. We're weighed down by high electricity costs, unreliable logistics, and suffocating red tape. Meanwhile, the very sector we hail as the backbone of our economy, our micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), receives only lip service. Real support must be more than slogans; it requires strategic investment and legislative will.\nOne of the starkest examples is how far behind we are in MSME financing compared to our neighbors. The Philippines lent just $11.6 billion to MSMEs in 2019. Thailand, in the same period, lent over $218.2 billion. The disparity is alarming, and it tells us that while we speak of empowering small businesses, we are not backing it up with real resources.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThrough ECOP’s advocacy, we continue to push for policy reforms that matter. We've long supported amendments to the Magna Carta for MSMEs, reforms in investment-related laws, and improvements in infrastructure and digitalization. But we need a Congress willing to champion these causes too, not just pass laws that sound good but fail to deliver real impact.\nAnother matter that must be approached with care is the ongoing push for a legislated wage hike. While the intention may be noble, the reality on the ground is more complicated. A blanket increase will help only a small minority of workers while hurting the vast majority, especially small businesses already struggling to stay afloat. It's a risk we cannot afford, especially now. There's a reason we have tripartite mechanisms—they're designed to ensure that decisions are balanced, inclusive, and sustainable.\nInvestors are watching all of this unfold. And what they see, unfortunately, is a country struggling with policy inconsistency, scandals, and a legislative agenda that too often chases headlines instead of long-term reform. We were once among the top choices for firms exiting China. Now, we're barely on the list. That’s a wake-up call.\nWe need to change the narrative. We need to build credibility. And we need to show, through sound laws and firm leadership, that the Philippines is open for business in the truest sense.\nAt ECOP, we remain committed to being a steady voice for employers. Our work in policy advocacy, capacity-building, and social dialogue continues, and we invite our leaders in government to walk with us on this journey. Let's focus on what really matters. Let's reform where it counts. Let's rebuild this economy together.	"\\tImages/prioritizing-the-economy-refocus-reform-rebuild_1.png"	The Philippine economy needs urgent attention, focusing on attracting investments, supporting small businesses, and creating jobs.  MSMEs are underfunded compared to neighboring countries, highlighting a need for increased financial support and policy reforms.  A legislated wage hike risks harming small businesses already struggling.  The country needs to build credibility to attract investors and improve its business climate.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/04/prioritizing-the-economy-refocus-reform-rebuild
pdic-asset-sales-surge-25-in-2024-on-strong-acquired-closed-bank-property-disposal	PDIC asset sales surge 25% in 2024 on strong acquired, closed-bank property disposal	State-run Philippine Deposit Insurance Corp. (PDIC) has raked in a total of ₱411.4 million from the sale of 281 closed-bank properties in 2024, a 24.7-percent increase from the ₱300-million sales in the previous year.\nAccording to PDIC, this improvement is reflective of its “effective asset disposal strategies.”\nOut of the 281 properties sold, 71 were assets acquired by PDIC, and the remaining 210 belonged to closed banks.\nOf the total sales, ₱194.9 million was raised through public biddings to ensure more competitive pricing.\nUnsold assets from public biddings were offered through negotiated sale. As such, the remaining ₱216.4 million was generated from negotiated sales as an alternative method of asset disposal.\nAlthough the number of assets sold in 2024 remained the same as in the previous year at 281, the total value exceeded the minimum bid price of ₱398.3 million by ₱13.1 million, or 3.3-percent higher.\nProceeds from the sale of closed bank assets are held in trust by PDIC and used to pay the claims of closed bank creditors, including depositors with uninsured funds.\nMeanwhile, proceeds from the sale of corporate assets contribute to the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), which serves as the main source for paying deposit insurance claims.\nThe Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP)-attached insurer said that it remains committed to improving its asset disposal programs “through innovative disposal strategies to attract more buyers, process streamlining to ensure efficiency and ease of transactions.”\nIt added that other strategies to optimize property values and maximize recoveries include “vigorous” marketing efforts such as buyer segmentation and profiling, partnership with the Home Development Mutual Fund (Pag-IBIG), virtual tours for interested bidders, and an improved property search engine on the PDIC assets for sale microsite.\n“With these measures, the corporation aims to further increase asset sales, improve financial recoveries, and support the stability of the financial system by helping ensure funds are plowed back to the economy by way of investments and/or savings,” PDIC said.

no-more-lines-gsis-hits-99-online-transactions-in-h1-2025	No more lines: GSIS hits 99% online transactions in H1 2025	State-run Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) has reported that more than 99 percent of its transactions in the first half of 2025 were conducted online. From January to June, nearly all GSIS services, such as applying for loans and checking member information, were available via the GSIS Touch mobile app and GSIS Wireless Automated Processing System (GWAPS) kiosks. According to the state pension fund, this shift to digital services means greater convenience for members, who can now make transactions anytime and anywhere without having to line up at GSIS offices. “Applying for loans, checking records and accessing benefits can all be done with just a few taps on your phone,” GSIS president and general manager Wick Veloso said in a June 5 statement. GSIS data showed that all member information inquiries and almost all loan computations and applications were handled digitally in the first half of the year. Online loan applications increased from 98.5 percent in the first quarter to 99.1 percent in the second, while loan computation requests stayed above 99.5 percent. GSIS also reported high member use of digital channels for the mandatory annual renewal of pensioners’ status, called APIR or Annual Pensioners’ Information Revalidation. In the first quarter of 2025, 95 percent of APIR transactions were done digitally through the GSIS Touch app and GWAPS kiosks. This climbed to 97 percent in the second quarter, showing members’ increasing preference for the convenience of online “digital GINHAWA” services. With more than two million registered users, the GSIS Touch app offers 24/7 access to loan applications, benefit monitoring, pensioners’ status renewal, compliance, and other services, enabling members, including those in remote or overseas areas, to manage their accounts anytime. “We are committed to expand our digital services so that every member can experience digital GINHAWA, wherever they are,” Veloso said. “I urge those who haven’t downloaded the GSIS Touch app to do so now and to keep their contact details updated for uninterrupted access,” he added.

leaked-index-proposal-rocks-pse	Leaked index proposal rocks PSE	The Philippine Stock Exchange is seeking input from select market players on proposed changes to the criteria for inclusion in the bourse’s benchmark and other indices, but a leak resulted in a plunge in the share price of China Banking Corporation.\nThe proposal sent to some fund managers as well as select foreign and local brokers included a simulation using the proposed criteria, which showed that Chinabank and San Miguel Corporation would be removed while Aboitiz Power Corporation and Wilcon Depot would be added.\nStock traders said the leak sparked off foreign selling in Chinabank shares, which caused its share price to fall 9.13 percent to ₱65.70 from its closing price of ₱72.30 in the previous day.\nOn the other hand, AboitizPower saw its share price rise 3.94 percent to ₱39.60 from its closing price of ₱38.10 last Wednesday.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAfter trading closed, the PSE issued a statement admitting that it solicited comments from key stakeholders (fund managers and certain foreign and local brokers) on possible revisions to its index policy.\n“Only AFTER such comments are received and evaluated will PSE consider if there is even a need to change its present index rules. If and when PSE decides to institute any changes to its index policy, the appropriate announcement will be made and ample time will be provided before implementation,” the bourse said.\nSome stock traders said this could have been avoided if there had been more transparency in the solicitation of comments.\nAmong the proposed changes, the criteria for index inclusion include a reduction in the free float requirement to 15 percent from the current 20 percent for companies with a market capitalization of more than ₱120 billion.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe PSE explained that lowering the minimum public float requirement for firms with large market capitalizations “increases the likelihood that large and liquid companies can be included in the PSE indices even if their free float is lower than the minimum free float requirement for index inclusion of 20 percent."\nFor the liquidity criteria, it is also proposed that the PSE will consider both median trading activity ratio (MTAR) and average daily value turnover (ADVT), while the current criteria use the median daily trading value.\nThe PSE stated that the MTAR addresses limitations in liquidity measurement by measuring the proportion of a company’s free float that is actively traded, providing a more accurate and proportional view of a company’s tradability compared to the current median daily trading value.\nOn the other hand, incorporating an ADVT requirement can offer a more thorough evaluation of baseline liquidity for index inclusion, thereby improving the assessment of investability.

pse-sees-record-influx-of-young-tech-savvy-stock-traders	PSE sees record influx of young, tech-savvy stock traders	The Philippine Stock Exchange reported that a number of accounts opened with its trading participants jumped by 50.1 percent to 2.86 million last year from 1.91 million in 2023, due to a 62.0 percent surge in online accounts to 2.47 million from 1.53 million.\n“This 50 percent jump in number of accounts is the highest we have recorded since we started tracking the investor count and profile in 2008,” said PSE President and CEO Ramon S. Monzon.\nHe noted that, “This substantial growth was made possible by the enabling of digital platforms to connect to PSE”s trading engine, thereby facilitating the trading by investors in the market. PSE is committed to being true to its advocacy of promoting financial inclusion.”\n“More than the numbers, what is important is that retail investors are equipped with investment know-how to avoid investing pitfalls. We address this need for investor education through our various investing literacy initiatives,” Monzon added.\nRetail investors comprised 98.9 percent of total account owners, while institutional investors made up the remaining 1.1 percent. Meanwhile, 99.0 percent of accounts were owned by local investors, while foreign investors held the rest.\nThe average value of online trades went up by 7.9 percent to ₱50,746.82. Its non-online counterpart also rose by 4.5 percent to an average of ₱99,823.86 per transaction.\n“While growth in retail accounts has been remarkable, the real challenge is getting retail investors to participate more actively in our market as they only contribute 16 percent to total value turnover.\n“We are optimistic that the upcoming reduction in stock transaction tax (STT) to 0.1 percent from 0.6 percent, along with the various investor education programs and upcoming pipeline of products of the Exchange, will encourage greater investor activity for the remainder of 2025,” Monzon noted.\nThe easing of STT is among the salient provisions in Republic Act No. 12214 or the Capital Markets Efficiency Promotion Act, which was recently signed into law.\nFor both total and online accounts, there were slightly more female investors than male investors at 50.7 percent to 49.3 percent and 50.8 percent to 49.2 percent, respectively.\nThe 30 to 44 age range had the largest share in total and online accounts and recorded a slight uptick in their share from the previous year’s data. They cornered 48.8 percent of total accounts from 45.6 percent and 51.6 percent of online accounts from 49.0 percent in 2023.\nThe second biggest age group, the 18 to 29 year olds, also registered growth in its number of retail investors. They had 26.5 percent of total accounts from 19.5 percent and 28.4 percent of online accounts from 21.5 percent previously.\nThe two remaining age groups posted a decline in their retail investor segment. The 45 to 59 age range saw a dip to 17.4 percent from 20.2 percent for total accounts and 16.3 percent from 18.6 percent for online accounts.\nThe portion of accounts by those aged 60 and above shrunk to 7.3 percent from 14.8 percent in terms of total accounts and to 3.7 percent from 10.9 percent for online accounts.\nIn terms of annual income, investors making less than ₱500,000.00 a year continued to have the biggest portion of retail accounts. Their share in total accounts rose to 82.4 percent from 70.9 percent and 86.2 percent from 76.7 percent for online accounts.\nThe two remaining income categories had a reduction in their portion of accounts. Investors earning above ₱1 million saw their total accounts share decrease to 10.9 percent from 14.7 percent and 9.1 percent from 11.4 percent for online accounts.\nThe share in total accounts of those earning between ₱500,000.00 and ₱1 million dwindled to 6.7 percent from 14.4 percent and 4.7 percent from 11.9 percent for online accounts.\nInvestors based locally and overseas made up 99.4 percent and 0.6 percent of total accounts and 99.5 percent and 0.5 percent for online accounts, respectively.\nThe share of Metro Manila-based investors slipped to 49.3 percent from 68.2 percent for total accounts and to 47.3 percent from 68.0 percent for online accounts. Meantime, the number of accounts in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao all recorded an increase.\nFor Luzon, it rose to 28.4 percent from 18.6 percent for total accounts and to 29.6 percent from 18.7 percent for online accounts. The total accounts of investors in Visayas grew to 10.8 percent from 6.6 percent while online accounts jumped to 11.0 percent from 6.5 percent.\nMindanao-based investors doubled their total and online accounts to 10.9 percent from 5.5 percent and 11.5 percent from 5.8 percent, respectively.\nMeanwhile, in terms of foreign nationality, Japanese, Chinese, and American citizens had the most number of accounts. Their share to total accounts was at 29.9 percent, 19.8 percent, and 13.0 percent, respectively.\n“We continue to see the impact of partnerships between PSE-accredited trading participants and digital platforms as we see a younger and more geographically diverse investor base,” Monzon said.

This growth is attributed to a 62 percent surge in online accounts, facilitated by digital platforms connecting to the PSE's trading engine.  The 18-29 and 30-44 age groups showed the most significant growth in retail investors.

railway-system-the-alternative	Railway system: The alternative	Discussions at the unveiling of Metrobank’s newest brand campaign mantra, “Let’s Grow Together”—a continuation of its more than 30-year-old slogan, “You’re in Good Hands”—centered on the President’s decision to temporarily halt the much-criticized two-year closure to “rebuild EDSA,” the country’s main thoroughfare.\nIt’s not entirely about the bad optics or the public's negative reactions, but I believe the realization that a partial closure could disrupt business flow might contribute to an economic slowdown, as seen with the temporary closure of the San Juanico Bridge.\nThough the importance of optics cannot be overstated, the exchanges during the event also delved into the President's empathy regarding the travel difficulties and additional costs and burdens on commuters. More importantly, they focused on the further development of the country’s railway system.\nThose were the days when the Philippine National Railways (PNR) operated inter-provincial and inter-city commuter trains, with lines reaching as far as Laguna, Quezon, and Bicol in the south, and from Tutuban to Dagupan and San Fernando, La Union, in the north.\nBased on the Global Competitiveness Report of 2019, the Philippines was considered a laggard in this particular mode of transportation, with the lowest efficiency score among its regional peers in terms of train services.\nFrom what I've heard along “da riles,” the Marcos administration is seriously considering an unprecedented push for comprehensive railway development across the archipelago.\nDescribed as a “railway renaissance,” PNR Chairman Michael Ted Macapagal explained that the plan spans the entire country, aiming to modernize public transportation and boost economic connectivity.\n“The railway renaissance under the Marcos administration represents more than just infrastructure development. It embodies the President’s vision for national progress, economic growth, and improved quality of life for all Filipinos.”\nThe success of these railway initiatives will be bolstered by strategic international partnerships, particularly with allies like the United States, Japan, South Korea, and the European Union.\nThe laundry list of railway projects could reach a staggering trillions of pesos in total cost. This includes the ongoing Metro Manila Subway at ₱488.5 billion; ₱873.62 billion for the North-South Commuter Railway; ₱64.19 billion for the LRT-1 expansion; ₱9.5 billion for the LRT-2 East Extension; and the MRT-3 expansion at ₱29.6 billion; and MRT-4 at ₱100 billion.\nMeanwhile, MRT-7 is a project of diversified food conglomerate San Miguel Corporation Chair Ramon S. Ang, with a total cost of ₱77 billion.\nOn the other hand, the U.S. government will bankroll the Subic-Clark-Manila-Batangas (SCMB) Freight Railway, a flagship project that represents the administration’s commitment to creating efficient cargo corridors across Luzon. The SCMB project exemplifies how the Philippines’ railway development has earned international confidence and support.\nAdditionally, there’s a plan to link Subic Bay’s strategic port facilities with Clark’s economic zone, Manila’s commercial hub, and Batangas in the south, supporting the province’s growing industrial sector.\nThis project is designed to further facilitate freight movement and reduce logistics costs for businesses operating in these key economic corridors. The total project cost, based on the feasibility study, is around ₱200 million.\nAlso, the North-South Commuter Railway project, designed to connect Metro Manila with surrounding provinces, has set ambitious completion targets for its various phases.\nAnchored on the vision of a shift towards mass transportation, the Metro Manila Subway, which is currently causing traffic in the heart of the Pasig-Ortigas area, will serve key areas from Quezon City to Pasay. For us commuters, it will provide high-capacity transportation solutions for thousands daily.\nThis 36-kilometer underground railway, representing the country’s most ambitious underground transit project, is expected to commence initial operations by 2028, with full system completion shortly thereafter.\nIn the words of Macapagal: “The main aspiration is to improve the lives of our fellow citizens through safe, comfortable, accessible, and efficient travel while focusing on an integrated transportation network that supports economic growth and reduces traffic congestion.”\nThis thrust aligns with the new Metrobank brand-marketing slogan of “You’re in good hands” and transcends to “Let’s grow together.”\nTalkback to me at sionil731@gmail.com	"\\tImages/railway-system-the-alternative_1.png"	The Philippines plans a comprehensive railway development across the archipelago, aiming to modernize public transportation and boost economic connectivity.  This "railway renaissance" includes projects like the Metro Manila Subway and the North-South Commuter Railway, totaling trillions of pesos. International partnerships with the US, Japan, South Korea, and the EU will support these initiatives. The goal is to improve citizens' lives through efficient and accessible travel, reducing traffic congestion and fostering economic growth.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/06/railway-system-the-alternative
philippine-unemployment-rate-rises-to-41-in-april	Philippine unemployment rate rises to 4.1% in April	The country’s unemployment and underemployment rates marginally increased in April this year, according to data released by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) on Friday, June 6.\nAccording to the latest Labor Force Survey, the national unemployment rate increased to 4.1 percent in April, up from 3.9 percent in March and 3.8 percent in February. The April jobless rate, however, remained lower than the 4.3 percent recorded in January. \nThe PSA noted that the number of unemployed workers in April reached 2.06 million, an increase from 1.93 million in March and 1.94 million in February. The underemployment rate also climbed to 14.6 percent in April, higher than the 13.4 percent in March and 10.1 percent in February, and also surpassed the 13.3 percent seen in January. \nADVERTISEMENT\nThe PSA defines underemployed workers as those who are already employed but are seeking additional jobs or more work-hours. \nIn April 2025, 7.09 million of the 48.67 million employed individuals expressed a desire for additional work hours in their current job, an additional job, or a new job with longer hours.\nPSA Undersecretary and National Statistician Dennis Mapa noted that despite the slight uptick in unemployment, the number of employed individuals in April was still higher by 317,000 compared to January, attributing this to a higher number of people joining the workforce during the period.\nMeanwhile, Department of Economy, Planning, and Development (DEPDev) Officer-in-Charge and Undersecretary Rosemarie G. Edillon said that despite the slight uptick in unemployment, the Philippine labor market continues to demonstrate resilience amid global headwinds. \nADVERTISEMENT\nShe added that the government remains on track to meet its target unemployment range of 4.4 percent to 4.7 percent set under the Philippine Development Plan 2023-2028.\nJob growth was sustained in key sectors, with the services sector employing 30.14 million individuals, up from 29.72 million in April 2024, and the agriculture sector seeing an increase to 10.02 million from 9.8 million. \nEdillon added that the government is also optimistic about further improving the labor force with the rollout of the Trabaho Para sa Bayan (TPB) Plan and the influx of new investments. \nShe enumerated government initiatives such as the enhancement of the Technical, Vocational and Livelihood track in Senior High School, the Government Internship Program for new graduates, and various skills training programs.\nEdillon noted that leveraging the role of the private sector in training and skills development allows the workforce to benefit from industry expertise. \nShe explained that under the Enterprise-Based Education and Training Framework, the government, in partnership with the private sector, will co-develop programs focusing on digital, technical, and soft skills. \nADVERTISEMENT\nTo ensure workers remain agile, Edillon said that the development and promotion of a national policy for lifelong learning must be prioritized, with the effective implementation of the Expanded Tertiary Education Equivalency and Accreditation Program supporting lifelong learning by recognizing prior learning and work experience.\nEdillon added that the government will continue promoting measures to improve the productivity of domestic industries, particularly those that generate higher-quality jobs, to enhance the resilience of the labor market amid external uncertainties. \nShe said that attracting more investments to generate higher-quality and better-paying jobs, particularly in manufacturing and higher-value-added services, and expanding into new markets is essential to broadening the economy and opening up more job opportunities. \nIn line with this, the newly created Semiconductor and Electronics Industry Advisory Council will proactively assist local firms in expanding their product mix and upgrading technological capacity.

philippine-dollar-reserves-bolster-external-stability-hit-105-5-billion-in-may	Philippine dollar reserves bolster external stability, hit $105.5 billion in May	The Philippines’ external financial standing strengthened in May this year, as the country's gross international reserves (GIR) posted a notable increase, bolstering its capacity to withstand external economic pressures.\nThe Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) reported that the country’s GIR reached $105.5 billion at end-May 2025, higher compared with $105.3 billion at the end of April, providing a robust external liquidity buffer for the country.\nBSP Governor Eli M. Remolona, Jr., said the latest GIR level provides a robust external liquidity buffer, equivalent to 7.3 months' worth of imports of goods and payments of services and primary income. \nADVERTISEMENT\nIt also covers about 3.7 times the country's short-term external debt based on residual maturity.\nThe month-on-month increase in the GIR level was primarily due to three factors. First, there were upward valuation adjustments in the BSP’s gold holdings, driven by the increase in the price of gold in the international market. \nSecond, net income from the BSP’s investments abroad contributed to the rise. Third, the national government’s net foreign currency deposits with the BSP also contributed to the accumulation.\nThe net international reserves (NIR) also registered an increase, rising by $0.08 billion from $105.26 billion as of end-April 2025 to $105.34 billion as of end-May 2025. \nADVERTISEMENT\nAccording to the BSP, this indicates a consistent strengthening of the country's external position. \nThe BSP has consistently managed the country's reserves to ensure ample liquidity and financial system stability. The current levels provide a significant buffer against potential external shocks and support the country's payment obligations for imports and external debt.\nMichael L. Ricafort, Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. chief economist, said a slight increase last month comes after two consecutive months of decline and a general downward trend since October 2024, when the "Trump factor" began to emerge as an external risk. \nRicafort noted that the primary driver for the increase was the continued rise in gold holdings, which reached a new record high of $13.7 billion. This represented a month-on-month increase of 2.9 percent and a year-on-year surge of 37 percent. \nWorld gold prices recently hovered near record highs of $3,500.10 per ounce on April 22, 2025. The gains in gold holdings offset a decline in foreign investments, which fell by $251 million month-on-month to $86.4 billion. \nThis decline in foreign investments, lower than the record high of $95.2 billion in September 2024, was attributed to the ongoing "Trump risk factor/premium" that has led to global market volatility, particularly a net sell-off in US financial markets and other risky asset classes since Trump's reciprocal tariffs on April 2, 2025.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHowever, Ricafort added that this has been partially offset by a shift of funds into safer havens such as gold, the Swiss franc, and the euro.\nThe RCBC chief economist noted that the GIR remains above the US$100-billion mark for the 20th consecutive month, signaling a strong external position for the country that can help stabilize the peso exchange rate and support the Philippines' favorable credit ratings.	"\\tImages/philippine-dollar-reserves-bolster-external-stability-hit-1055-billion-in-may_1.png"	Philippine gross international reserves (GIR) reached $105.5 billion in May 2025, a month-on-month increase.  The rise is attributed to increased gold holdings, net income from investments abroad, and government deposits. This provides a robust external liquidity buffer, equivalent to 7.3 months of imports and 3.7 times short-term external debt.  The increase follows two months of decline, but the GIR remains above $100 billion for the 20th consecutive month.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/06/philippine-dollar-reserves-bolster-external-stability-hit-1055-billion-in-may
pse-hails-new-law-cutting-stock-transaction-tax-by-83	PSE hails new law cutting stock transaction tax by 83%	The Philippine Stock Exchange, Inc. (PSE) thanked President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. for signing into law R.A. No. 12214 or the Capital Markets Efficiency Promotions Act (CMEPA).\n“The immediate reduction of the stock transaction tax (STT) to 0.1 percent from 0.6 percent is a much-awaited reform that will be beneficial to stock market investors.\n“It is expected to boost trading activity and liquidity in the stock market and PSE's competitiveness against other foreign markets. Prior to the enactment of CMEPA, PSE had one of the highest friction costs in the ASEAN region,” the bourse said.\nCMEPA also expands the application of STT to other securities listed and traded through a local stock exchange, which lends certainty to the tax regime applicable to the secondary transfer through the stock exchange of asset classes other than equities and facilitates the launch of more products in the local stock market.\nIt also includes several key provisions that are expected to support capital market development, such as a broader and clearer definition of securities to simplify the tax treatment of various financial instruments, which can accelerate the development of new products such as derivatives.\nThe PSE said the reduction of documentary stamp tax on the original issuance of shares of stock from 1 percent of the par value to 0.75 percent of the par value of such shares of stock will also benefit companies that issue new shares via IPO or subsequent equity listings.\nIn relation to the Personal Equity and Retirement Account (PERA), the grant of additional 50 percent tax deduction on actual contributions by private employers who contribute an equal or greater amount to their employees' contributions to PERA, is likewise expected to help spur transactions in the stock market.\n“PSE would like to thank the Senate of the Philippines and the House of Representatives under the able leadership of Senate President Francis G. Escudero and Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez and the Senate and the House Ways and Means Committees chaired by Senator Sherwin T. Gatchalian and Representative Joey S. Salceda, respectively, for championing the approval of this bill.\n“The Exchange also extends its deep gratitude to Special Assistant to the President for Investment and Economic Affairs Secretary Frederick D. Go for championing this transformative capital market reform and to Department of Finance Secretary Ralph G.

philippine-rice-stocks-grow-14-in-may	Philippine rice stocks grow 14% in May	The country’s rice inventory jumped by 14 percent to over two million metric tons (MT) in May, aligning with the government’s ongoing efforts to ensure food sufficiency and stabilize prices.\nIn its latest report, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) said rice stocks stood at 2.37 million MT as of May 1, up from 2.08 million MT in the same month last year.\nMonth-on-month, the volume of rice stocks inched up by one percent from the 2.34 million MT recorded in April.\nPSA data showed that 49.4 percent of the total rice stocks were from households, 33.9 percent were from the commercial sector, and 16.8 percent from the warehouses of the National Food Authority (NFA).\nAs of May 1, rice stocks in households increased by 35 percent to 1.17 million MT compared to 863,770 MT in the same month last year.\nMeanwhile, rice inventory in the commercial sector slumped by 30 percent to 803,440 MT versus last year’s 1.14 million MT.\nNFA stocks, on the other hand, saw a massive jump from 69,350 MT last year to 397,210 MT—a staggering 472-percent hike.\nCompared to April data, rice stocks from NFA depositories surged by 15 percent. Rice inventory in the commercial sector and households, however, fell by two percent and 0.3 percent, respectively.\nThe Department of Agriculture (DA) has been strengthening its efforts to secure a strong rice supply to help lower prices of the staple, which is seen as integral in slowing down inflation.\nIn a statement last week, Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel said it is the clear directive of the Marcos administration to ensure that food is “sufficient and affordable.”\nThis year, the DA has been implementing programs such as the maximum suggested retail price (MSRP) on rice and the ₱20-per-kilo rice initiative, which empowers the NFA to significantly ramp up purchases of rice from local farmers, alongside its aim to lower prices.\nLaurel attributed the steady decline in rice prices as a key driver in the slowdown of the headline inflation in May, which logged 1.3 percent—the lowest since the 1.2 percent in November 2019.\nNational Statistician Claire Dennis Mapa said the recent adjustments in retail rice prices are expected to influence inflation through at least August.\nBased on PSA data, rice accounts for ₱9 of every ₱100 spent by the average Filipino. This figure doubles among the bottom 30-percent income households.\nFurther, the statistics agency said the country’s corn stocks as of May 1 went down by six percent to 671,100 MT from 710,720 MT in the previous year.\nOn a monthly basis, corn inventory rose by three percent compared to April’s 653,350 MT.\nOf the total inventory, 84.5 percent of the corn were from the commercial sector, while the remaining 15.5 percent were from households.\nCorn stocks in households recorded 104,090 MT, 82-percent higher than the 57,140 MT last year.\nCommercial corn stocks, meanwhile, declined by 13 percent to 567,020 MT from 653,580 MT in 2024.\nIn comparison to the April data, corn stocks in the commercial sector went up seven percent.

gokongwei-spends-158-billion-to-reacquire-rrhi-shares-from-rustan-stock-swap	Gokongwei spends ₱15.8 billion to reacquire RRHI shares from Rustan stock swap	Robinsons Retail Holdings, Inc., a member of the Gokongwei Group, has reacquired 22.2 percent of the company’s stock from GCH Investments Pte. Ltd., a subsidiary of DFI Retail Group, for ₱15.77 billion. In a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange, RRHI said it has reacquired 315.31 million of its common shares belonging to DFI under a duly approved special block sale. As background, DFI became a minority shareholder of RRHI in 2018 when Robinsons Retail acquired 100 percent of Rustan Supercenters, Inc. (RSCI) through a share-for-share swap transaction with DFI, valued at ₱18 billion. DFI further increased its stake in the company when it purchased secondary shares from members of the Gokongwei family and also in the market, reaching a 20 percent stake in RRHI at that time. The transaction was executed through a special block sale on the Philippine Stock Exchange, following the fulfillment of the closing conditions. “The transaction price was determined through mutual agreement between RRHI and GCH, taking into account prevailing market conditions and strategic considerations,” RRHI said. It funded the share repurchase through a combination of internal resources and external borrowings, while maintaining ample financial flexibility after the buyback. RRHI said it views this buyback transaction as a strategic move to optimize capital allocation and create more value for its stakeholders. It added that the ongoing share repurchase program reflects the company’s belief that current market prices do not fully reflect the underlying financial strength and long-term growth prospects of RRHI. “DFI has been instrumental in RRHI’s growth over the last few years. Our acquisition of RSCI in 2018 and Rose Pharmacy in 2020 from DFI has allowed us to enter the premium food retail business and expand our drugstore presence in the Visayas and Mindanao regions as we added The Marketplace, Shopwise, and Rose Pharmacy into our portfolio,” said RRHI President and CEO Stanley C. Co. He added that, “This partnership has also paved the way for RRHI to become the exclusive distributor of DFI’s private label brands – Meadows and Guardian – in the country. For this, we are deeply grateful for the partnership we have forged with DFI through the years.” “More importantly, our arrangement with DFI to exclusively distribute the Meadows and Guardian brands in the Philippines will continue following this transaction. These brands continue to gain traction in the market, and are a testament to our shared commitment in providing consumers innovative and affordable options. We remain firmly aligned with our commercial objectives and look forward to strengthening this collaboration in the years to come,” noted Co.

philippines-oldest-business-group-warns-of-instability-if-senate-fails-to-proceed-with-vp-dutertes-impeachment-trial	Philippines' oldest business group warns of 'instability' if Senate fails to proceed with VP Duterte's impeachment trial	The country’s oldest business group is pushing the Senate to perform its constitutional duty and start the impeachment trial of Vice President Sara Duterte, warning that failure to do so could breed “instability.”\nIn a statement, the Chamber of Commerce of the Philippine Islands (CCPI) said it was clearly defined in the 1987 Constitution that the impeachment trial should proceed immediately.\n“The Constitution is very clear: in case a resolution of impeachment is filed by at least one-third of the members of the [Lower] House...trial by the Senate shall forthwith proceed,” CCPI said.\n“Forthwith in any dictionary, means ‘immediately,’ ‘without delay,’” the group stressed.\nThe word, “forthwith,” has been the crying call of various civil society and academic groups in urging the upper chamber to convene as an impeachment court.\nThe House of Representatives impeached the Vice President on Feb. 5 on the grounds of betrayal of public trust, culpable violation of the Constitution, bribery, graft and corruption, and other high crimes.\nThe articles of impeachment, which details the impeachment complaint, were then swiftly transmitted to the Senate.\nHowever, the complaint was only referred to the upper chamber’s committee on rules on Monday, June 9, with the convening of an impeachment court still not certain.\nThe three-month delay aligned with the recess of the 19th Congress during the period of the midterm elections.\nCCPI, headed by its president Jose Luis Yulo, said the delay is unconstitutional as the recess of Congress is not recognized under the rules of impeachment.\n“The Senate no longer acts as a legislative Senate per se, but as an impeachment court having acquired automatic jurisdiction over the impeachment case per the Constitution,” it pointed out.\nOnce convened, the business group said the impeachment trial should carry over into the 20th Congress “until acquittal or conviction.”\nSenators Risa Hontiveros and Koko Pimentel echoed this view, describing the impeachment as a non-legislative function of the Senate, which suggests that it should continue once the new slate of lawmakers assume their seats on July 28.\n“We are a country that is governed by the ‘rule of law,’ not of men,” said CCPI.\nThe group said if the Senate fails to act on their constitutional duty, this may create an “environment of instability.”\nCCPI said this will negatively impact the local business community, and potentially, may even have sweeping effects on international businesses.\n“We pray that the members of the Senate will properly and duly perform their official duties as mandated by the Constitution,” it said.\nApart from CCPI, Makati Business Club (MBC) also urged senators to commence the impeachment trial, citing the need to uphold accountability to maintain investor confidence.	"\\tImages/philippines-oldest-business-group-warns-of-instability-if-senate-fails-to-proceed-with-vp-dutertes-impeachment-trial_1.png"	The Chamber of Commerce of the Philippine Islands (CCPI) urges the Senate to immediately start VP Duterte's impeachment trial, citing the Constitution's mandate.  A three-month delay is deemed unconstitutional, as the Senate should function as an impeachment court.  Failure to proceed could create instability, negatively impacting businesses.  Both CCPI and Makati Business Club advocate for the trial's commencement.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/10/philippines-oldest-business-group-warns-of-instability-if-senate-fails-to-proceed-with-vp-dutertes-impeachment-trial
mvp-warns-against-unfair-telco-playing-field-in-konektadong-pinoy-bill	MVP warns against 'unfair' telco playing field in Konektadong Pinoy bill	Tycoon Manuel V. Pangilinan, president and chief executive officer (CEO) of PLDT Inc., warned that certain provisions of the Konektadong Pinoy bill could be exploited to foster an unfair playing field in the local telecommunications sector.\nPangilinan issued the statement during PLDT’s 2025 annual stockholders’ meeting, which was preceded by the recent ratification of the measure in Congress, one step closer to its enactment.\nCertified as urgent by the Marcos administration, the bill aims to enhance competition in the telco industry, improve the quality of internet services, and promote digital connectivity nationwide.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAt its core, it aims to significantly expand the country’s digital landscape by streamlining licensing processes for network providers, thereby providing a more seamless entry for foreign telecom operators.\nPangilinan said he agreed with this aim of the bill, however, he noted that it should be done in a manner that is fair for existing telco companies who have heavily invested in the country.\n“We are prepared to compete, but we’re not asking for special favors, and neither should special favors be given to external operators because we have invested a lot, all of us have invested a lot in this market,” said Pangilinan.\n“So, what we're asking is a level playing field when it comes to competition. We don't ask for private protection. We don't ask for protective measures to postpone competition,” he added.\nMarilyn Victorio-Aquino, PLDT senior vice president and corporate secretary, said if the government wants to strengthen competition in the industry, it should be fair and sustainable or else the subscribing public will be affected.\nUnder Konektadong Pinoy, Aquino said existing telcos remain obligated to continue building infrastructure to improve their services.\n“There is no such obligation imposed on new entrants that are involved in data transmission,” she noted.\nAquino said foreign telcos looking to expand in the country will be able to tap the existing network infrastructure in the country, which was primarily built by companies such as PLDT.\nShe added that the industry wants to avoid providing free access to satellite operators to use existing frequencies and spectrum, without the same obligations imposed on local telcos.\nWithout an obligation to uphold public interest, foreign operators will not be covered by the government’s right to temporarily take over assets and operations of telco companies in times of national emergency.\n“So while we applaud the effort to try and improve competition, it cannot be at all cost. National security and sovereignty of the country must be protected,” said Aquino.\nThe Philippine Chamber of Telecommunications Operators (PCTO) previously questioned the Konektadong Pinoy bill for not requiring a legislative franchise requirement for international gateway facilities, cable landing stations, and satellite service providers.\nThe group said this will allow foreign-controlled companies to control critical information infrastructure essential for national security.\nIn the same manner, PCTO said the measure should require prospective telco firms to comply with national and global cybersecurity practices prior to starting operations.\nFollowing the ratification of the bill in the Senate and the House of Representatives, it will now be sent to Malacañang for the president’s signature.	"\\tImages/mvp-warns-against-unfair-telco-playing-field-in-konektadong-pinoy-bill_1.png"	PLDT's Manuel Pangilinan expressed concern over the Konektadong Pinoy bill, fearing it could create an unfair advantage for new entrants.  He stressed the need for a level playing field for existing telcos who have heavily invested in the country's infrastructure.  PLDT SVP Marilyn Victorio-Aquino highlighted the lack of obligations on new entrants regarding infrastructure development and national security concerns. The bill's passage raises concerns about fair competition and the protection of national interests.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/11/mvp-warns-against-unfair-telco-playing-field-in-konektadong-pinoy-bill

pagcor-launches-second-phase-of-600-million-pma-facility-construction	Pagcor launches second phase of ₱600-million PMA facility construction	State-run Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp. (Pagcor) has launched the second phase of construction for the Philippine Military Academy Alumni Association Inc. (PMAAAI) building at Fort Andres Bonifacio in Taguig City, with total funding of ₱600 million. The ceremonial launch, held on Tuesday, June 10, was led by Pagcor Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Alejandro H. Tengco. Pagcor initially approved a ₱300-million budget for the building’s structural phase, followed by another ₱300 million for the ongoing interior fit-out. The six-story facility is being funded by Newport World Resorts Foundation, the corporate social responsibility (CSR) arm of one of Pagcor’s licensed integrated resorts. “This project is truly remarkable because it is being constructed at no cost to the Philippine government,” Tengco said. He emphasized that the initiative demonstrates how a well-regulated gaming industry can contribute meaningfully to nation-building. Once completed, the building will serve as PMAAAI’s official headquarters and host leadership training, strategic forums, and programs to develop future Filipino military leaders, Pagcor said. Tengco expressed confidence that the planned Center for Leadership Excellence within the facility will not only strengthen the PMAAAI as an institution but also help empower the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and support its personnel. He added that the gaming industry, under strong regulatory oversight, continues to back high-impact, socially relevant projects. “This structure is solid proof of what can be achieved when public service and private enterprise share a vision of progress and patriotism,” he said. Tengco also reaffirmed Pagcor’s broader support for the AFP. Earlier this year, the agency allocated funds for several PMA projects, including a modern warfare laboratory, new sports facilities, a patient transport vehicle, and the renovation of the Candidate Control Liaison Office in Quezon City.

philippine-banks-bad-loan-ratio-rises-to-34-as-loan-growth-slows-repayment-lags	Philippine banks' bad loan ratio rises to 3.4% as loan growth slows, repayment lags	The Philippine banking system’s gross non-performing loan (NPL) ratio climbed by nine basis points (bps) to 3.39 percent in April, reversing the improvement seen in March, as loan growth slowed and more borrowers fell behind on payments, according to the central bank.\nThe latest data from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) showed that the banking industry’s NPL ratio rose at the start of the second quarter, from a three-month low of 3.3 percent at the end of the first quarter.\nIt was still lower than the 3.45-percent gross NPL ratio seen in April last year.\nBSP data showed bad loans increased by 0.6 percent to ₱519.2 billion as of end-April from ₱516.1 billion in March. Year-on-year, soured loans hiked by eight percent from ₱480.6 billion in April last year.\nLoans become non-performing if unpaid for at least 90 days past due date, posing a credit risk as borrowers are less likely to repay.\nPhilippine banks’ total loan portfolio decreased by 1.9 percent to ₱15.34 trillion as of end-April from ₱15.63 trillion in the first quarter. Year-on-year, the end-April figure jumped by 10 percent from the ₱13.94 trillion recorded at the end of April last year.\nPast due loans increased by 1.1 percent to ₱653.3 billion as of April from ₱646.4 billion a month ago. It also increased by 5.7 percent from ₱618 billion in the previous year.\nThis brought the past due ratio to 4.26 percent, up from 4.14 percent in March but lower than last year’s 4.43 percent.\nPast due loans are those where the borrower has failed to pay principal, interest, or any installment on time, including restructured loans and other financial assets.\nRizal Commercial Banking Corp. (RCBC) chief economist Michael Ricafort said that banks’ gross NPL ratio as of April increased slightly “due to slower growth in bank loans.”\nRicafort said that uncertainties over higher tariffs imposed by United States (US) President Donald Trump and trade wars “could slow down the world economy and indirectly the local economy, especially exporters.”\nThis, in turn, “could slow down employment, sales, incomes, and ability to pay by some borrowers, thereby leading to more NPLs than otherwise,” he said.\nHowever, this development may be offset by the one-percent cut by the US Federal Reserve and the BSP since late last year, along with possible further cuts in the coming months.\nRicafort said these could lower borrowing and financing costs, which may help some borrowers repay their loans, especially as inflation continues to ease.

what-the-next-doe-secretary-really-needs-to-hear	What the next DOE Secretary really needs to hear	Energy Secretary Raphael Lotilla’s exit may be drawing cheers from the camp he’s headed to, but back in the energy sector, the real prayer is this: bring in a new Secretary who comprehensively knows the policy playbook—and one who isn’t afraid to run it fairly and objectively across every chain of the industry.\nThe industry players are already getting apprised of a shortlist, but their silence at this point is more deafening and louder than the unspoken words, and that really says everything!\nFor now, the industry’s only real wish is simple: that the next Energy Secretary shows up ready to lead; and not treat the position as part of a learning curve—because the highly technical and complex power sector in particular, has tangled problems; hence, the industry shall not be taken as a classroom, and there’s no time for training wheels.\nThey’re also laying down their respective policy wish list on the table – hoping that what they deem essential will likewise be given sharp focus by the incoming leader at the energy department. So far, the guessing game in the industry is that Energy Undersecretary Sharon Garin will eventually secure the top seat at the DOE.\nMeanwhile, at the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC), the industry rumor mill is also continuously churning out information, with some quarters suggesting that current DOJ Undersecretary Jesse Andres might stage a comeback as Commission Chairman. However, it’s still early to tell, because some groups are reportedly also expressing a preference for leadership at the regulatory body.\nThe ERC will also have two vacancies because two of its Commissioners – Alexis Lumbatan and Catherine Maceda – will be retiring in July; and there are already talks on potential candidates, including speculated transfer of Energy Undersecretary Rowena Guevara to the Commission; but if the industry players will be given their way, they would prefer Guevara to stay put at the DOE because she is considered as the ‘policy force’ in the concretization of the green energy auction program (GEAP) for the influx of renewable energy (RE) investments in the country.\nSimilarly, there are industry whispers that Atty Lew Carlo Lopez, who is currently Group Head for Government Relations at Terra Solar of the Pangilinan-led Meralco PowerGen, is being eyed for Commissioner post at the ERC; with some industry circles noting that his resume will not just fuel this; but also by strategic family ties that has links to the seat of power in the Palace.\nNo letup on RE capacity tendering\nThe investors are already on board, but the next fourth to sixth rounds of green energy auctions (GEAs 4-6) will be a task to be delivered by the incoming Energy Secretary, as they will solidify the energy transition agenda that the Marcos administration has been advancing.\nFor GEA-4, the target is to add 9,378 megawatts (MW) of new capacity from ground-mounted solar, rooftop solar, floating solar, and onshore wind projects; and the unique feature of that tender process will be the 1,100MW integrated renewable energy and energy storage system (IRESS) package; which has been intended to “enhance grid reliability and flexibility while supporting the country’s growing electricity demand.” \nGEA 5, on the other, will chase capital injection from offshore wind projects although the terms of reference (TOR) for this wave of capacity offer has yet to be firmed up; and it will be up to the next DOE leadership to do the heavy lifting on crafting a package that could actually lure investors’ appetite; while GEA-6 will hunt for investments on waste-to-energy (WTE) and biomass facilities.\nNuclear power: Proceed with caution\nCertainly, nuclear shall be continuously studied and weighed as part of the country’s future energy mix; but the next Energy Secretary better move with caution. Primarily, no fast-tracking any safety bill without a thorough study, because rushing the rollout of this technology could blow up more than just the grid, but the entire future of the Philippine energy sector.\nThe industry players are raising red flags over the mad rush to ram through the PhilAtom Bill before the Senate closes its 19th Congress sessions; warning that half-baked laws won’t cut it when it comes to nuclear, and that every angle of the regulatory agency must be hammered out with deep scrutiny before such legislative measure would be enacted into law.\nAdditionally, the successor-Energy Secretary is being reminded that instead of giving more focus to foreign technology suppliers at this stage, the DOE’s real job now is education – primarily arming the future domestic nuclear workforce with know-how and expertise; and more importantly, reading the room and actually getting people’s pulse to win over communities where these plants are set to be sited.\nMore than anything, the DOE must also draw a hard line: the country’s nuclear policy will cover every detail from ‘cradle to grave’; and the Philippines shall not serve as a testing ground or guinea pig for the small and micro-modular reactors being advanced by foreign interests.\nTake it easy on priority dispatch for gas \nRepublic Act 12120, which was enacted early this year, has two key provisions: a) to grant priority dispatch to power generated from indigenous gas; and b) to set a mandated minimum share of electricity using indigenous natural gas.\nBut here’s the catch: the priority dispatch and mandated gas quotas incorporated in the law threaten to distort the free-market rulebook of the deregulated power sector; and that will risk higher power bills for consumers and directly clashing with Electric Power Industry Reform Act’s (EPIRA’s) core promise of ‘least cost’ and competitive electricity dispatch in the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market. Sources emphasized that “while the new gas mandate is well-intentioned, it departs from the principle of least cost generation, potentially forcing higher-cost power into the system.”\nBeyond these concerns, it is also the wish of the industry that the next Energy Secretary will focus on solving the problems at home, because most of the dilemmas wanting immediate attention are domestic, and most foreign investors already have their in-country representation. After all, most of the Cabinet secretaries that had been terminated from service were the ‘frequent fliers’.\nThen within the ranks of the DOE personnel, they’re hoping their next boss respects them as professionals committed to serve the country; and not be treated as easy mark to be thrown things at, shouted at or humiliated in public; and they’re holding out for a leader who actually walks the talk on moral integrity.\nFor feedback and suggestions, please email at: myrnamvelasco@gmail.com	"\\tImages/what-the-next-doe-secretary-really-needs-to-hear_1.png"	The energy sector desires a new Secretary with comprehensive policy knowledge and unbiased leadership.  The next Secretary must be ready to lead, not learn on the job, focusing on renewable energy and navigating complex issues.  Nuclear power development requires caution and thorough study; prioritizing domestic workforce development is key.  The new Secretary should address domestic issues and treat DOE personnel with respect.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/02/what-the-next-doe-secretary-really-needs-to-hear
wilcon-depot-eyes-rebound-in-second-half-pours-32-billion-into-nationwide-expansion	Wilcon Depot eyes rebound in second half, pours ₱3.2 billion into nationwide expansion	While earnings are seen to be flat this year, the Philippines’ leading home improvement and finishing construction supplies retailer, Wilcon Depot, Inc., is increasing its capital expenditure budget by 45 percent to ₱3.2 billion from ₱2.2 billion last year.\nIn an online media briefing, Wilcon Vice President for Investor Relations Jean Alger stated that the bulk of this year’s capital expenditure (capex) will be allocated for new stores and warehouses, as the firm continues to expand nationwide in anticipation of a recovery in sales.\nWilcon President and CEO Lorraine Belo-Cincochan said they are planning to open a total of eight stores this year, even though the home improvement market still has to recover.\nThe balance of the capex will be spent on store and transportation equipment (₱327 million), renovations and repairs (₱ 568 million), and its IT infrastructure (₱137 million).\nWilcon is focusing on growing its online or e-commerce platforms to capture the younger segments of the market after noting that consumers from the younger generations, including early nesters, are more into making online purchases.\nMeanwhile, Wilcon Senior Executive Vice President and COO Rosemarie Bosch-Ong said they expect earnings to sales to start growing in the second half of the year after registering a drop in the first quarter of 2025.\nShe noted that, sales have started to pick up in May after the mid-term elections and they hope this will continue in June until the rest of the year.\n“Although we’re seeing growth, we’re very conservative in our estimate. We’re looking at the single digit (same store sales growth), probably in the low side because the first quarter was not really that good,” said Ong.\nShe added that, “We’re still experiencing the different headwinds that we’ve experienced in the past year. But, looking at the coming months, we’re looking at a very good showing, especially towards the end of June.”\nWilcon is hoping that an expected cut in interest rates will boost sales, especially in its business-to-business market as well as for consumers who have mortgages.\nAlger also pointed out that growth will also be due to the lower base set by the second half of 2024 since they had one-time charges during this period, including damage due to a fire in one of their branches, while sales were still strong in the first semester last year.\nHowever, she said earnings will be “flattish” this year since “we’re actually just looking at recovering the decline that we had in the first quarter. So we’re just looking at getting it even.\n“But if sales will pick up some more, then we have just flattish to like a very low growth in the earnings if the impact can really be felt in the second quarter.”	"\\tImages/wilcon-depot-eyes-rebound-in-second-half-pours-32-billion-into-nationwide-expansion_1.png"	Wilcon Depot, a leading home improvement retailer, plans an ₱3.2 billion nationwide expansion, opening eight new stores this year.  Despite flat earnings projected for 2025, sales are expected to rebound in the second half, driven by post-election growth and anticipated interest rate cuts. The company is also focusing on e-commerce to reach younger consumers.  They project single-digit same-store sales growth.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/16/wilcon-depot-eyes-rebound-in-second-half-pours-32-billion-into-nationwide-expansion
philippines-sovereign-debt-risk-low-think-tank	Philippines' sovereign debt risk 'low'—think tank	The Philippines has a "low" sovereign debt risk despite its ballooning obligations, but think tank Capital Economics cautioned that emerging markets (EMs) with better managed public finances should not rest on their laurels amid lingering fiscal strains.\nIn a June 12 report authored by Capital Economics senior EMs economist Liam Peach, the Philippines joined India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Morocco, Chile, and Uruguay in the EM group with "low risk, but fiscal position not bulletproof."\nCapital Economics defined this group as having "generally strong public finances, but still [with] some risks around the fiscal stance."\nThe group in which the Philippines belongs "includes those with solid fiscal metrics, strong credit ratings and low bond spreads, but whose public finances are not bulletproof—these EMs are not immune to adverse fiscal developments and their public finances risk slowly worsening over a longer time horizon," the think tank explained.\nEarly this month, Finance Secretary Ralph G. Recto told Manila Bulletin that credit ratings agencies are "not worried" about Philippine public debt accumulation, which he said is outpaced by economic growth.\nThe national government's outstanding debt inched up to a new high of ₱16.75 trillion at end-April. By end-2025, the debt pile is projected to climb to a record ₱17.35 trillion.\nRecto also noted that the Philippines' budget deficit, which is partly financed by borrowings, is on a downward trajectory.\nAs the Marcos Jr. administration embarks on fiscal consolidation to narrow the yawning budget deficit and lower the share of public debt to the economy following massive borrowings at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, the World Bank Group (WBG) had projected the fiscal deficit to narrow gradually from 5.7 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2024 to 5.4 percent in 2025, 4.9 percent in 2026, 4.4 percent in 2027, 4.1 percent in 2028, 3.9 percent in 2029, 3.7 percent in 2030, and 3.6 percent in 2031.\nThe debt-to-GDP ratio was also expected by the WBG to decline from 60.7 percent last year to 60.2 percent this year, 59.7 percent next year, 59.6 percent in 2027, 59.1 percent in 2028, 58.9 percent in 2029, 58.6 percent in 2030, and 58.1 percent in 2031, according to the Washington-based multilateral lender's newest six-year country partnership framework (CPF) for the Philippines.\nAt the end of the first quarter of 2025, the debt-to-GDP ratio climbed to 62 percent—the highest since the previous Duterte administration ramped up borrowings to fight the health and socioeconomic crises wrought by Covid-19.\nThe Marcos Jr. administration aims to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio to below 60 percent by the time the President steps down in 2028. Before the pandemic struck, the public debt ratio fell to a record low of 39.6 percent in 2019.\nAcross all EMs, Capital Economics noted that "sovereign debt risks remain much higher than in the pre-pandemic period."\n"The weaker state of EM public finances reflects larger debt burdens and budget deficits and higher interest costs. The EM median public debt-to-GDP ratio is now at 58 percent and rising, compared to 50 percent in 2019. The median EM government is now running a budget deficit of four percent of GDP, which is 1.5-percent-of-GDP higher than the pre-Covid average," the think tank noted.\n"In the absence of significant fiscal tightening and lower borrowing costs, debt ratios are likely to rise further, putting upwards pressure on sovereign risk premia," it warned.\nAmong other EMs, Capital Economics cited that Sri Lanka, Ukraine, Ghana, Zambia, Lebanon, Venezuela, Ecuador, Tunisia, Angola, and Mozambique are already in default or at high risk of default.\nMeanwhile, Argentina, Nigeria, Egypt, Turkey, Pakistan, Kenya, and Jordan are facing "elevated" sovereign debt risks, even as they enjoy short-term stability.\nCapital Economics said South Africa, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Panama, Hungary, Romania, Ivory Coast, and Bahrain have "moderate risk" in their public debt levels, with medium-term debt sustainability concerns.\nAs for China, Czech Republic, Peru, the Baltic States, Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), these EMs have "very low" sovereign debt risks, Capital Economics said.	"\\tImages/philippines-sovereign-debt-risk-lowthink-tank_1.png"	Despite rising debt, the Philippines' sovereign debt risk is considered "low" by Capital Economics, but fiscal risks remain.  The think tank categorized the Philippines among EMs with strong public finances but acknowledges vulnerabilities.  The country's debt-to-GDP ratio reached 62 percent in Q1 2025, the highest since the Covid-19 pandemic.  The Marcos Jr. administration aims to reduce this ratio below 60 percent by 2028.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/13/philippines-sovereign-debt-risk-lowthink-tank
qantas-closes-jetstar-asia-to-streamline-operations	Qantas closes Jetstar Asia to streamline operations	The Qantas Group is closing its intra-Asia airline, Jetstar Asia, to strengthen its core businesses in Australia and New Zealand amid growing challenges.\nIn a statement, Vanessa Hudson, Qantas Group chief executive officer, said the closure of Jetstar Asia would free up about $500 million in capital, which will be reinvested into stronger-performing segments and strategic growth initiatives.\nSingapore-based Jetstar Asia will cease operations on July 31, 2025, following a progressively reduced schedule over the next seven weeks. \nThe closure is a direct response to growing challenges, including rising supplier costs (up to 200 percent), high airport fees, and intensified competition, which have collectively impacted the airline's ability to deliver comparable returns to the group's stronger core markets. \nThe airline was expected to incur a $35 million underlying earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) loss in the current financial year prior to this decision.\nThe closure will impact only 16 intra-Asia routes, with no changes to Jetstar Airways and Jetstar Japan services into Asia, nor Jetstar Airways' international services in and out of Australia. Jetstar Asia’s 13 Airbus A320 aircraft will be progressively redeployed to Australia and New Zealand.\nQantas said this redeployment is expected to create more than 100 local jobs, offer more low fares, and replace leased aircraft in Jetstar Airways' domestic operations, thereby reducing its cost base.\nSome aircraft will also support fleet renewal in Qantas’ regional operations, particularly those servicing the resources sector in Western Australia.\n"Jetstar Asia has been a pioneering force in the Asian aviation market for more than 20 years, making air travel accessible to millions of customers across Southeast Asiam.\nShe added, "We are incredibly proud of the Jetstar Asia team and the work they have done to deliver low fares, strong operational performance and exceptional customer service. This is a very tough day for them." She noted that despite their best efforts, significant increases in supplier costs materially changed Jetstar Asia's cost base.	"\\tImages/qantas-closes-jetstar-asia-to-streamlines-operations_1.png"	Qantas is closing Jetstar Asia on July 31, 2025, freeing up $500 million for reinvestment.  The closure addresses rising supplier costs and intensified competition impacting profitability.  Jetstar Asia's 13 aircraft will be redeployed to Australia and New Zealand, creating jobs and lowering costs.  This decision, while tough for employees, is intended to strengthen Qantas' core businesses.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/11/qantas-closes-jetstar-asia-to-streamlines-operations
oil-prices-surge-markets-retreat-after-israels-strike-on-iran	Oil prices surge, markets retreat after Israel's strike on Iran	HONG KONG — Oil prices surged and Asian shares were lower Friday after Israel struck Iranian nuclear and military targets in an attack that raised the risk of all-out war between them.\nU.S. benchmark crude oil rose by $3.93, or 5.8 percent, to $71.97 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, increased by $3.82 to $73.18 per barrel.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn share trading, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 fell 0.9 percent to 37,834.25 while the Kospi in Seoul edged 0.9 percent lower to 2,894.62. Hong Kong's Hang Seng retreated 0.9 percent to 23,831.48 and the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.7 percent to 3,378.76.\nAustralia's S&P/ASX 200 drifted 0.2 percent lower to 8,547.40.\n"An Israeli attack on Iran poses a top ten of our global risk, but Asian markets are expected to recover quickly as they have relatively limited exposure to the conflict and growing ties to unaffected Saudi Arabia and the UAE," said Xu Tiachen of The Economist Intelligence.\nOn Thursday, U.S. stock indexes ticked higher following another encouraging update on inflation across the country.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.4 percent to 6,045.26. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.2 percent to 42,967.62, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.2 percent to 19,662.48.\nOracle jumped 13.3 percent after reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected.\nThat helped markets offset a 4.8 percent loss for Boeing after an Air India plane crashed Thursday, killing more than 240 people. It was the first crash of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, and the cause wasn't immediately known.\nStocks broadly got some help from easing Treasury yields in the bond market following the latest update on inflation. Thursday's update said inflation at the wholesale level wasn't as bad last month as economists expected, and it followed a report on Wednesday saying something similar about the inflation that U.S. consumers are feeling.\nWall Street took it as a signal that the Federal Reserve will have more leeway to cut interest rates later this year in order to give the economy a boost.\nThe Federal Reserve has been hesitant to lower interest rates, and it's been on hold this year after cutting at the end of last year, because it's waiting to see how much President Donald Trump's tariffs will hurt the economy and raise inflation. While lower rates can goose the economy by encouraging businesses and households to borrow, they can also accelerate inflation.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.35 percent from 4.41 percent late Wednesday and from roughly 4.80 percent early this year.\nBesides the inflation data, a separate report on jobless claims also helped to weigh on Treasury yields. It said slightly more U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than economists expected, and the total number remained at the highest level in eight months. That could be an indication of a rise in layoffs.\nThe Fed's next meeting on interest rates is scheduled for next week, but the nearly unanimous expectation on Wall Street is that it will stand pat again. Traders are betting it's likely to begin cutting in September, according to data from CME Group.\nTrump's on-and-off tariffs have raised worries about higher inflation and a possible recession, which had sent the S&P 500 roughly 20 percent below its record a couple months ago. But stocks have since rallied nearly all the way back on hopes that Trump will lower his tariffs after reaching trade deals with other countries.\nMany of Trump's tariffs are on hold at the moment to give time for negotiations, but Trump added to the uncertainty late Wednesday when he suggested the United States could send letters to other countries at some point "saying this is the deal. You can take it or you can leave it."\nIn currency trading early Friday, the U.S. dollar gained to 143.70 Japanese yen from 143.46 yen. The euro edged lower, to $1.1537 from $1.1590.	"\\tImages/oil-prices-surge-markets-retreat-after-israels-strike-on-iran_1.png"	Oil prices surged after Israel's attack on Iran, raising war concerns. Asian markets fell, with the Nikkei 225 and Kospi down 0.9 percent.  US markets saw mixed results; Oracle's strong earnings offset Boeing's losses following a plane crash.

overseas-remittances-surge-to-27-billion-amid-stable-global-employment	Overseas remittances surge to $2.7 billion amid stable global employment	Cash sent home by Filipinos working and living overseas continued to increase in April, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) data showed, reflecting stable global employment abroad.\nMoney sent in by overseas Filipinos (OFs) increased by four percent to $2.7 billion in April from $2.6 billion in the same month last year, the BSP reported.\nCash remittances for the first four months also rose by three percent to $11.1 billion from $ 10.78 billion posted in the same period last year.\nCash remittances coursed through banks in the first four months were predominantly from the United States (US), followed by Singapore, Saudi Arabia, and Japan, according to BSP’s statement released on Monday, June 26.\nAs such, remittances for these countries were the drivers of the overall increase during the period.\nBy source, the US remained the top source of cash remittances during the period at 40.4 percent, followed by Singapore (7.3 percent) and Saudi Arabia (6.3 percent).\nSeveral money transfer centers in countries abroad send money through partner banks, known as correspondent banks, most of which are based in the US, the central bank noted.\nIt added that remittances sent through money couriers are recorded under the country where their main offices are based—often the US—rather than the actual country of origin.\n“Therefore, the US would appear to be the main source of OF [overseas Filipino] remittances because banks attribute the origin of funds to the most immediate source,” the BSP said.\nPersonal remittances, or the sum of transfers sent in cash or in-kind via informal channels, also increased by 4.1 percent to $3 billion in April from $2.9 billion in the previous year.\nYear-to-date personal remittances also climbed by three percent to $12.4 billion from the $12 billion registered in January-to-April period last year.\nThe BSP attributed the increase in personal remittances to the rise in both land-based and sea-based OFs\nJohn Paolo Rivera, senior research fellow at state-run policy think tank Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS), said that the increase in cash remittances “shows underlying strength in remittance flows, driven by stable overseas employment, particularly in the US, Middle East, and parts of Asia.”\n“Moving forward, remittance growth is likely to remain steady, supported by demand for OFWs abroad, especially in healthcare, logistics, and domestic services,” Rivera said.\nRivera noted that weaker peso may encourage more US dollar remittances, but risks such as inflation in host countries, geopolitical tensions, and potential policy changes like remittance taxes in key markets like the US could weigh on future inflows.

new-naia-terminal-5-to-reorganize-airline-assignments-for-efficiency	New NAIA Terminal 5 to reorganize airline assignments for efficiency	New NAIA Infra Corp. (NNIC) is set to reorganize the terminal assignments of foreign and domestic carriers following the completion of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) Terminal 5 to improve efficiency.\nManila International Airport Authority (MIAA) General Manager Eric Ines said the private operator of the country’s main gateway aims to serve more than 60 million passengers annually.\nInes said NNIC is looking to significantly improve the terminals and the efficiency of runway use to accommodate more flights, which will bring an influx of passengers from around the world.\nHe told reporters that this plan is underway, as the San Miguel Corp. (SMC)-led consortium is currently demolishing the long-abandoned Philippine Village Hotel in Pasay City to clear the area where Terminal 5 will be built.\nConstruction is expected to begin immediately after demolition is completed, with initial operations scheduled to commence within two to three years.\nNNIC President Ramon Ang earlier said that Terminal 5 will handle approximately 35 million passengers annually.\nInes, who heads the agency regulating NAIA, stated that the terminal will be the new home for domestic carriers, alongside Terminal 2.\nHe said Terminal 1 will be intended for low-cost international carriers, while Terminal 3 will be utilized for full-service foreign airlines.\nCurrently, Terminal 1 handles international flights, Terminal 2 serves domestic flights, and Terminal 3 accommodates both local and international operations.\nNNIC’s plan to expand airport capacity aims to capitalize on the steady growth of foreign carriers launching direct flights to the Philippines.\nAir Canada recently launched non-stop flights between Manila and Vancouver, while Air India will begin direct flights from Delhi to Manila in October.\nWith the ongoing improvements at NAIA, Ines said several foreign carriers have expressed interest in launching flights to the Philippines.\nLast year, a record 50.1 million passengers used the country's main gateway, representing a 10 percent increase from the 45 million passengers in 2023.\nThe MIAA chief expects this year to smash the record, with the daily influx of passengers averaging between 150,000 to 160,000 compared to last year’s 130,000.\n“That's why kahit na punuin mo man ‘yung immigration magkakaroon pa rin ng pila, bottleneck pa rin (That’s why even if you fully staff immigration, there will still be lines, there will still be a bottleneck). The only thing you can do is really widen the entire area,” said Ines.\nNNIC, which took over operations and maintenance of NAIA in September 2024, has committed to spending over ₱170 billion to elevate the airport to world-class standards.\nSince then, the operator has been ramping up major improvements to rehabilitate and upgrade NAIA, which was once tagged as the world’s worst airport.	"\\tImages/new-naia-terminal-5-to-reorganize-airline-assignments-for-efficiency_1.png"	New NAIA Terminal 5 will reorganize airline assignments to improve efficiency and accommodate over 60 million passengers annually.  The terminal will house domestic carriers alongside Terminal 2, while Terminal 1 will be for low-cost international carriers and Terminal 3 for full-service foreign airlines.  Construction is set to begin soon after demolition of the Philippine Village Hotel, with operations starting in two to three years.  This expansion capitalizes on increased foreign carrier interest and aims to transform NAIA into a world-class airport.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/16/new-naia-terminal-5-to-reorganize-airline-assignments-for-efficiency
motorists-brace-for-near-p5-liter-fuel-hike-next-week	Motorists brace for near ₱5/liter fuel hike next week	A big-time fuel price hike, estimated at nearly ₱5 per liter, is set to rock motorists next week, driven by external shocks from escalating Middle East tensions.\nBased on the four-day Mean of Platts Singapore (MOPS), gasoline could see an upward adjustment of ₱2.50 to ₱3.20 per liter, with diesel potentially climbing between ₱4.30 and ₱4.80 per liter.\nKerosene is also anticipated to go up around ₱4.25 to ₱4.40 per liter.\nThese adjustments are likely caused by the ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, particularly between Iran and Israel.\nThe Department of Energy’s (DOE) Oil Industry Management Bureau (OIMB) said that this major price shock directly correlates to shipping disruptions.\n“Major oil price shock looming as [the] Israel-Iran conflict threatens critical global shipping passage,” said Rodela Romero, OIMB director.\nJetti Petroleum president Leo Bellas elaborated that this could affect supply transportation in the Strait of Hormuz, where a significant portion of the world’s oil shipments pass, potentially leading to further disruptions in global fuel supply and price volatility.\n“[There are] concerns that a direct United States involvement would widen the conflict and trigger direct attacks on energy infrastructures, have caused the further spike in prices,” he added.\nEarlier this week, the DOE looked into the possibility of rolling out fuel subsidies to the transport and agriculture sector, noting the allocated budget under the General Appropriations Act (GAA) of 2025.\nAccording to the DOE, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) has a ₱2.5 billion fuel subsidy for public utility drivers, including taxis, ride-hailing services, and delivery platforms.\nThe Department of Agriculture (DA), on the other hand, has about ₱585 million in subsidies for farmers and fisherfolk.

oil-prices-spike-ahead-of-independence-day	Oil prices spike ahead of Independence Day	Fuel prices are set to increase ahead of the celebration of Philippine Independence Day on June 12. Effective Tuesday, June 10, gasoline prices will inch up by ₱0.60 per liter, while diesel will go up by ₱0.95 per liter. Kerosene is also set to climb by ₱0.30 per liter. Shell Pilipinas, Cleanfuel, PetroGazz, Seaoil, and Caltex are among the few oil companies that have announced these price movements. According to the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Oil Industry Management Bureau (OIMB), these price hikes are caused by the continued geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine, as well as the United States (US) and Iran. Additionally, the US is seeing a significant reduction in its crude oil inventories, alongside Canada’s decrease in production due to wildfires. On the demand front, Jetti Petroleum previously indicated an expected increase in fuel demand due to the summer season, which could have affected the price adjustments this week.

philippines-gets-500-million-adb-loan-to-improve-agriculture-sustainability	Philippines gets $500-million ADB loan to improve agriculture sustainability	The Philippines will receive a $500-million loan, or about ₱27.9 billion, from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support efforts to make the local agriculture sector more sustainable through 2030.\nADB agriculture, food, nature, and rural development sector office senior director Qingfeng Zhang said the loan agreement is part of the Manila-based multilateral lender’s plan to invest $1.5 billion for its program to build clearinghouse facilities across Asia and the Pacific.\nThese facilities will be developed by the bank alongside global research organization Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), with financing support from Gates Foundation.\nThe ADB said the program aims to improve the agriculture sector’s productivity sustainably, while enabling it to adapt to harsher climate conditions and reducing water and carbon footprints.\nThis is envisioned to boost investments in sustainable and low-carbon rice production, with the intent of improving the lives of millions of vulnerable smalltime farmers.\n"Rice is essential to food security in Asia, supplying over a quarter of the region's calorie intake, and half in Southeast Asia. For hundreds of millions of smallholder farmers, rice is not just food, it is their livelihood," said ADB vice-president for sectors and themes Fatima Yasmin in a statement.\n“Today, that livelihood is increasingly threatened by extreme weather and environmental degradation," she added.\nOn its website, the ADB emphasized that rice farming continues to face “mounting pressure” over declining productivity and shrinking water supplies as climate change heats up.\nLeft unaddressed, the bank said this threatens food security and the well-being of the poorest and most vulnerable communities, particularly in Asia and the Pacific.\nInternational Rice Research Institute (IRRI) Director General Yvonne Pinto said establishing the clearinghouse facilities will not only help improving these dire conditions but could also drive further innovations.\n"We can drive sustainable and resilient transformation of the rice sector in Asia and transform the lives of millions of smallholder farmers now and in the future," Pinto said.\nFor the Philippines, Zhang told reporters that the $500-million funding will mostly be utilized for rice farming, irrigation, and agricultural and logistics development.\nThe aforementioned facilities are also being developed for Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, and Pakistan.\nThe $1.5-billion funding for the program is part of the ADB’s broader $40-billion commitment to food systems transformation by 2030.\nLast month, the bank said this assistance will enable Asia-Pacific produce diverse and nutritious food, create jobs, reduce environmental impacts, and strengthen agricultural supply chains.\nTo support this goal, the funding seeks to modernize agricultural value chains to improve access to affordable and healthy food for vulnerable populations.\nIt will also invest in soil quality, biodiversity conservation, and digital technologies to improve decision-making for farmers, agribusinesses, and policymakers.

new-sec-chief-francis-lim-vows-no-nonsense-but-fair-regulation	New SEC chief Francis Lim vows 'no-nonsense' but fair regulation	New Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Francis Ed. Lim President aims to transform the commission into “a no-nonsense regulator—firm when necessary, but always fair, efficient, reliable, and professional.”\nLim officially took over on June 10, 2025, from Emilio B. Aquino after the end of his seven-year term. President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. named Lim to the top position of the country’s company registrar and securities regulator on June 3.\nDuring the turnover ceremony, the former Philippine Stock Exchange president said, “I thank those who came before me—especially Chairperson Emil Aquino, who led the Commission over the past seven years…\nADVERTISEMENT\n“I commend your vision and commitment to transforming the SEC through SuperVision 2028. It is a bold, forward-looking roadmap, and we will carry it forward and refine it when needed or appropriate.\n“But let me be clear: proper execution is key and foremost—because vision without delivery is simply aspiration. Execution is where we will focus our energies.”\nHe noted that, “I don’t believe in reinventing the wheel. We will build on what works—refine it, improve it, and scale it with urgency and discipline. Continuity in best practices is just as important as innovation.”\nLim said he also envisions the SEC as “One that enables investment and business growth without compromising on integrity.”\n“Let’s also be honest: the Philippine capital market has been lagging behind. Inclusive growth demands deeper, broader, and more accessible capital markets,” he added.\nHe said the SEC will work with the Philippine Stock Exchange, Philippine Dealing and Exchange Corp., non-governmental organizations, and the three branches of government to push for meaningful reforms.\nFor his first order of business, Lim plans to “resolve all pending applications quickly and responsibly,” in line with time frames provided by law and pointing out that, “While we recognize the complexity of our work, we must uphold the standards. If this means working nights, weekends, or holidays, then that is what public service demands.”\n“We will work to further simplify and streamline everything we ask from the public. I know that some steps have been undertaken along this line, and we are committed to pursue them with more vigor. Every requirement must be justified…Let’s make it easier to comply, and harder to delay,” he said.\nLim said the SEC will also work to lower the cost of transaction for businesses particularly the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) since “Regulation must support, not suffocate.”\nIn a media huddle after the turnover ceremony, Lim said he will be looking at government-owned and controlled enterprises that can be encouraged to list at the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE).\nHe added that he will also be looking at private enterprises that were given government incentives with the commitment that they are to list part of their shares in the stock market.\n“That's not been fully implemented. The philosophy of the is that you are given incentives, you share the blessings to the public. Unfortunately, that has not been done,” he said.\nLim also plans to push for the passage of a "Capital Market Competitiveness Act,” the draft of which he was working on during his stint in the PSE. Lim said intends to work with the PSE in revisiting the draft bill, which aims to ease up the cost of doing business for companies that do list in the stock market.\nPrior to his appointment, Lim was a senior legal counsel at ACCRA Law, with expertise in securities and capital markets litigation, bankruptcy, insolvency, corporate rehabilitation, antitrust, and trade regulation.\nHe previously served as the president and chief executive officer of the Philippine Stock Exchange from 2004 to 2010, where he concurrently held positions in affiliated institutions, including the Securities Clearing Corporation of the Philippines and the Philippine Dealing and Exchange Corporation.\nLim has also been instrumental in drafting several rules promulgated by the Supreme Court as co-chairperson of the Rules on e-Commerce and Notaries Public sub-committees. He was likewise a member of the sub-committee on Commercial Courts, where he helped draft the Rules on Corporate Rehabilitation (2008) and Rules on Electronic Evidence (2011), among others.\nFor his work, Lim has been consistently recognized as a top lawyer by various bodies. He was named a Leading Lawyer in the practice area of capital markets by the Legal 500 Asia Pacific, and as a recommended lawyer in the practice area of tax in 2021. He was also part of the Philippines’ Top 100 Lawyers published by the Asia Business Law Journal in the same year.

The financing will be jointly implemented by the Anti-Red Tape Authority (ARTA), the Department of Trade and Industry’s (DTI) Board of Investments (BOI), and the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT).\n“The proposed program will support and strengthen the government’s efforts to enhance and improve the business environment, to achieve higher business formation and investment rates. This will boost competitiveness and private sector development, stimulating job creation and expanding economic opportunity,” the ADB said.\nSpecifically, “the program will reduce regulatory burden and increase transparency, facilitate investment in sectors with strong development impacts, and advance the transition to digital government,” the ADB added.\nAccording to the ADB, enhancing the business environment would facilitate increased downstream investments in the digital infrastructure and renewable energy (RE) sectors.\nThe ADB cited that the Philippines has experienced robust economic growth in recent years, with the private sector being a key driver—accounting for over 90 percent of employment and gross domestic product (GDP).\nHowever, “the enabling environment for the private sector is weak, and the country underperforms in several global measurements of ease of doing business,” the ADB lamented, citing the Philippines’ low rankings in the latest World Competitiveness Ranking, World Bank B-READY, and The Economist Business Environment Rankings.\n“In a 2024 survey, 63 percent of firms identified regulatory burden as a challenge. Furthermore, potential investors experience difficulty in navigating the investment approval process, such as accessing information on the required licenses and permits and the processes that need to be followed. Fragmented digital systems and a siloed approach to digital government increase costs and deter investors,” the ADB noted.\nAs such, “the Philippines attracts only five percent of Southeast Asia’s net foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows from 2014 to 2023, despite accounting for 11 percent of regional GDP and 16 percent of the region’s population in 2023,” it pointed out.\nIn particular, the ADB highlighted challenges posed by the complex and overlapping regulatory structure, cumbersome investment approval processes, as well as fragmented digital systems and a siloed approach to digital government service delivery.\nIn this regard, the ADB loan would support government reforms in the pipeline, namely: reducing regulatory burden and increasing transparency; facilitating investment in developmentally important sectors; and deepening digital government services.\nIn all, the ADB said it “seeks to invigorate the private sector as an engine of growth in the Philippines.”\n“The program’s development impact is to foster an enabling business environment to allow job-generating businesses and industries to grow. The expected outcome is to improve legal, regulatory, and institutional frameworks to make the country’s enabling environment more conducive for businesses,” it said.\nIt disclosed that the forthcoming regular loan requested by the Philippines “will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of three years; an interest rate determined in accordance with the ADB’s flexible loan product; [and] a commitment charge of 0.15 percent per year.”\n“Based on the annuity method, the average maturity is 12.1 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to the ADB,” it added.\nThe ADB sees no risks to lending to the Philippines, citing that “the country’s debt composition remains favorable, with two-thirds denominated in pesos, and debts are mostly medium- to long-term.”\nIt also noted that out of the Philippine government’s $43.8-billion total gross borrowing requirement for 2025, $5.3 billion would be sourced from bilateral and multilateral development partners, including the ADB.

The loan will support reforms to reduce regulatory burdens, increase transparency, and improve digital government services.  The Philippines' private sector accounts for over 90% of employment and GDP, but faces challenges in ease of doing business.  The ADB aims to invigorate the private sector as an engine of growth.  The loan has a 15-year term with a 3-year grace period.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/11/next-400-million-adb-loan-for-philippines-to-fund-tech-driven-business-environment-reform

peso-drop-vs-safe-haven-us-dollar-wont-stop-bsp-rate-cut-on-june-19	Peso drop vs. 'safe haven' US dollar won't stop BSP rate cut on June 19	Even as the Philippine peso depreciated against the United States (US) dollar at a pace that was among the worst among emerging market (EM) currencies last week, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) is still expected to cut interest rates this week.\nData from the Bankers Association of the Philippines (BAP) showed that the peso slipped back to the weaker ₱56 level versus the greenback last Friday, June 13—a development that bore the impact of Israel’s airstrikes against Iran’s nuclear program.\nFriday’s close at ₱56.21:$1 was the local currency’s weakest level since April 28, when it closed at ₱56.42.\nThink tank Capital Economics reported on June 13 that the Philippine peso was among the “worst-performing EM currencies” since June 6.\nCapital Economics deputy chief markets economist Jonas Goltermann noted that Israel’s overnight strikes on Iran allowed the US dollar to recover “some of the ground it lost earlier [last] week,” hence strengthening against the peso and other currencies.\nWhile the US dollar remains relatively weak, hitting an over three-year low, Capital Economics stressed that the greenback’s “safe-haven characteristics are still intact when it comes to at least some types of risk-off events.”\nIn its Asia FX weekly report dated June 13, Japanese financial giant MUFG Bank Ltd. also noted that the US dollar gained support from safe-haven demand after struggling recently. While it was a gain for the greenback, Asian currencies, particularly the peso, South Korean won, and Indian rupee, lost their footing due to their “sensitivity to risk and relatively higher reliance on oil imports.”\nEven with this favor to the US dollar, Capital Economics senior Asia economist Gareth Leather is still looking forward to the BSP trimming the key interest rates by another quarter-point on Thursday, June 19. “Our long-held forecast is that the central bank will cut rates by a further 75 basis points (bps) this year,” he said in a separate June 13 report.\nJohn Paolo Rivera, senior research fellow at state-run policy think tank Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS), said the local currency’s depreciation to the ₱56 level “may not be a game-changer just yet,” suggesting that the widely expected cut would still push through.\nBut a weaker peso “does add some pressure” on the Monetary Board (MB) ahead of its policy meeting.\n“While the recent trend of slowing inflation provides room for a rate cut, a weaker peso could complicate the decision, especially if it fuels imported inflation or affects market sentiment,” Rivera said. May’s 1.3-percent inflation rate was the lowest in five-and-a-half years.\nRivera argued that “if this depreciation is seen as temporary and driven by external factors (like global risk-off sentiment or a stronger US dollar), the MB may still proceed with a calibrated rate cut. But if the weakness persists or worsens, the BSP may opt to hold off on easing to maintain stability and manage inflation expectations.”\nFor Capital Economics, “the effects of [Israel’s] strikes may prove short-lived, at least in the absence of further escalation.” Should the Israel-Iran conflict subside soon, this would mean a weaker US dollar.\nAside from Capital Economics, Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. (RCBC) chief economist Michael Ricafort is anticipating a 25-bp cut this week, asserting that a rate cut tends to reduce the interest differential with the US dollar, a setup that could limit further declines in the strength of the local currency.\nHSBC ASEAN economist Aris Dacanay pointed towards favorable inflation as the major factor to the central bank’s expected decision to further reduce key borrowing costs.\n“Due to low inflation over the past two months and slow growth in the first quarter of 2025, we now expect the BSP to cut its policy rate by 25 bps to 5.25 percent [this] week,” Dacanay said. He previously projected a pause this week, considering the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) cautious approach reducing rates.\nMUFG Global Markets Research senior currency analyst Michael Wan said higher oil prices may pressure oil-importing currencies like the peso and Indian rupee. However, with manageable inflation and current account deficits, it would take a prolonged oil price surge to significantly shift the direction of Asian currencies, he said in another June 13 report.\nEconomists at Chinabank Research said that despite trading higher in recent days, with it hitting the highest last week, the dollar-peso exchange rate has “remained well below its historical highs, giving the BSP room to continue cutting interest rates.” This comes despite their expectation that the Fed will hold steady this week.\nA total of 100 bps has been shaved off key interest rates since the kick-off of the easing cycle in August last year. The BSP has so far brought down the policy rate to 5.5 percent from 6.5 percent a year ago.\nShould the BSP extend its loosening cycle by another 25 bps, the key policy rate would shrink to 5.25 percent from the current 5.5 percent.

A weaker peso adds pressure, but slowing inflation allows for a rate cut. Economists believe the peso's depreciation may be temporary, driven by external factors.  The BSP aims to maintain stability and manage inflation expectations.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/16/peso-drop-vs-safe-haven-us-dollar-wont-stop-bsp-rate-cut-on-june-19
philatom-ambiguity-its-raising-more-questions-than-answers	PhilAtom ambiguity: It's raising more questions than answers	Anyone seasoned in the trenches of the Philippine energy sector knows damn well that no law with decades-long consequences for the country and Filipino consumers gets slammed through a day of Congressional cocktail. Just ask the framers of the Electric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA) and the Renewable Energy Act – laws that battled through years of blood, sweat, tears, and floor debates before securing a majority of legislators’ votes.\nDecades later, even these fire-tested laws, despite being crafted with exhaustive deliberations, were still exposed for their flaws and had to be patched up with a slew of supplementary rules as some core components of the industry demanded tougher, smarter regulatory frameworks.\nBut just last week, what came crashing into the scene was the Philippine Atomic Energy Regulatory Authority (PhilAtom) bill, which blasted through the Senate floors with roughly zero questions and resistance, rubber-stamped by both Houses in a single day, and propped by a threadbare paper bicam that looked more like a legislative afterthought than a safeguard. This left anyone with a deep sense of national safety asking: did they even read the words “safety” and “regulation,” or did they just skim straight to “atomic” and call it a day?\nEvery market with nuclear facilities drums one word like a war chant: safety, SAFETY, S-A-F-E-T-Y; and that’s carved in stone. Then it’s also the first gospel they preach to any country chasing the atom. So, in all bluntness, what part of ‘safety’ are we still fumbling over here in the Philippines?\nSafety isn’t just paperwork; it’s a frontline defense\nSomehow, lawmakers and policy leaders need to wake up to this hard truth: without ironclad nuclear safety regulation, you're not steering a future-proof energy industry – you're wiring a global time bomb with shaky hands. And if we’re not being careful with our own process of safety regulation, what’s clear is that when a nuclear plant blows, the fallout doesn’t respect borders.\nSo if one country slacks on safety, everyone with this technology deployment in the world pays the price. That’s why international standards, primarily those of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), are pushed so hard, and they serve as solid survival protocols. On that tenet, any country shouldn’t be given a free pass – even those from the developing world like the Philippines – to rush half-baked laws when the risk on the table will have global implications. Because if you can’t even show backbone in shaping policies, don’t expect anyone to take you seriously when it comes to cracking down on safety enforcement.\nDon’t get me wrong here: nuclear power is certainly an unavoidable technology in the evolving energy game, especially as the world fights the devastating impact of climate change – and I’m all in on that. Nuclear isn’t just a solid baseload contender with costs dropping over decades; its carbon footprint would also be practically a whisper next to those choking thermal plants. The future demands it, whether we’re ready or not.\nBut then again, this should be etched at the top of every policymaker’s mind: nuclear regulation isn’t just about preventing accidents – it’s about enforcing a culture of engineering excellence, operational transparency, as well as zero-excuses accountability. It demands that governments and industry players not only build airtight rules but stress-test every inch of a technology deployment; plan like lives depend on it – because they do. And please, no cutting corners!\nWhy aren’t the tough questions asked?\nWhen the media started breaking the news about the bill’s passage, many people in the energy sector were left scratching their heads – with some of them not even oriented with what PhilAtom is. Then, after dissecting the bill’s provisions, the verdict came clear: the bill is peppered with many motherhood statements, a patchwork of vague rules pretending to chart the course for the Philippines’ nuclear comeback. That’s a flashing warning sign – and it became manifest that the legislation was hammered out without an extensive information and education campaign, even among the industry players who will also carry the weight of the nation’s nuclear future.\nDigging further into the bicam report, tough questions hit hard: PhilAtom is set to call the shots on nuclear plant siting – but what exactly does that leave for the DOE, the agency tasked with keeping the country’s power supply reliable? And how are they supposed to sync up with NGCP or the system operator to actually get their plant capacities wheeled into the grid? Grid integration is already a tangled nightmare for the Philippine power sector; don’t make things worse by bungling coordination on where to install those nuclear power plants.\nAside from PhilAtom’s criteria, isn’t it obvious that siting has to be locked in with DOE, so these plants land exactly where the power demand is needed – right at the load centers? This isn’t just a detail; nuclear planning has to run from cradle to grave. Are we really supposed to sit here guessing how this crucial middle ground gets managed? PhilAtom might argue that its sphere of regulation only delves with safety – but the point is: safety spans the whole supply chain – that means siting can’t be done as a separate scramble – it has to be locked down and coordinated right from day one.\nThe bill similarly hands PhilAtom the power to set aside funds for Radioactive Waste and Spent Fuel Management that shall be drawn from nuclear plant operators – and with the ERC merely ‘consulted’? Doesn’t this move shove ERC off its turf as the official tariff regulator for the power sector? Any cost slapped on power operators, even if not passed on to consumers, must fall squarely under ERC’s regulatory hammer. So for now, are we just going to sit tight and wait for the courts to sort out this emerging regulatory dilemma – that in the process, may drag us through years of legal battles before anyone has the guts to draw clear lines of authority?\nFine, the bill says consumers won’t foot the bill for this fund – but does PhilAtom even have the expertise to sniff out and stop nuclear plant owners from pulling ‘creative accounting tricks’ if they would sneak those costs right back onto consumer bills?\nOn nuclear technologies, the bill also infers that “for those parts of the design that are the same as the identified standard design or the reference plant design, the Authority shall consider accepting the safety assessment of an experienced foreign nuclear regulatory body” – so, does this entail that PhilAtom will no longer do technology review or re-licensing prior to installation? What if such technology deployment has concealed IP infringement issues – who’s going to pick up the pieces and manage the backlash?\nHere’s another loaded curveball in the bill: the PhilAtom Council can exempt reactor types from targeted installations – as long as the President signs it off via Executive Order. What does that mean exactly – are we allowing the Philippines to become a testing ground for nuclear tech still in its experimental infancy?\nThe bill further prescribes that PhilAtom may lean on outside consultants or external bodies, but only if it avoids ‘conflict of interest’ or ‘undue influence’ – fine words on paper, but here’s the real question: does that rule out advisers from countries peddling their own nuclear technologies to us? Because if we don’t draw the line, those cozy backdoor ties could morph into dirty deals faster than you can say ‘regulatory capture’.\nMany more provisions in the PhilAtom bill are screaming for deeper scrutiny – and if this will be signed by President Marcos into law, the real tough test begins with those crafting the implementing rules and regulations (IRR). They better come in sharp, ask the hard questions, and do the heavy lifting on policymaking. Nuclear safety regulation can’t just come with a ‘cheat code’ – and anyone popping the champagne this early is just celebrating blind. We don’t need a feel-good story; we want a rock-solid blueprint of safety regulation that can hold the weight of a technology to be depended upon by generations.\nFor feedback and suggestions, please email at: myrnamvelasco@gmail.com	"\\tImages/philatom-ambiguity-its-raising-more-questions-than-answers_1.png"	The PhilAtom bill passed the Senate with minimal debate, raising concerns about insufficient attention to safety regulations.  Without ironclad safety regulations, the Philippines risks creating a global time bomb. The bill contains vague rules and lacks crucial coordination between agencies, creating potential regulatory conflicts.  This rushed process neglects essential safety protocols and raises serious questions about the country's nuclear future.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/16/philatom-ambiguity-its-raising-more-questions-than-answers

Navarro Policy Center for Competitiveness, the local partner of IMD, stated that the country’s improvement this year occurred amid “geopolitical concerns and other uncertainties.”\nIn terms of economic performance, the Philippines improved its ranking to 33rd this year, up from 40th last year.\nThe strong performance this year is driven by positive developments in nearly all the sub-factors, including domestic economy, prices, employment, and international trade.\nAccording to IMD, only the international investment sub-factor saw a dip in its ranking from 44th last year to 45th in 2025.\nLast year, investments for projects approved by the country’s leading investment promotion agencies (IPAs) reached a record-high of ₱1.9 trillion.\nIn the first quarter of the year, seven of 13 IPAs reported approved investments worth ₱181.93 billion, down 44 percent from the ₱323.27 billion during the same period in 2024.\nFor business efficiency, the Philippines’ ranking declined 46th this year to 43rd last year.\nIn this factor, the country saw its labor market and attitudes and values factors worsened, while improving in terms of management practices and productivity and efficiency.\nTaking into account government efficiency, the Philippines’ position slipped this year, falling from 51st to 49th.\nUnder this factor, the country saw a marginal improvement in business legislation, while falling down in tax policy, institutional framework, and societal framework.\nIn infrastructure, which has long been flagged for being a perennial issue for the country’s competitiveness ranking, jumped one spot from 61st to 60th this year.\nIMD stated that recent developments in basic infrastructure and technological infrastructure pushed the ranking forward.\nOn the contrary, sub-factors related to health and environment and scientific infrastructure saw respective declines.\nUnder the 2025 World Competitiveness Ranking, Switzerland ranked first, followed by Singapore and Hong Kong.	"\\tImages/philippines-climbs-in-global-competitiveness-but-still-lags-in-asia-pacific_1.png"	The Philippines improved its global competitiveness ranking to 51st, up from 52nd, but still lags in Asia-Pacific, ranking 13th out of 14.  Strong economic performance, particularly in domestic economy, prices, employment, and international trade, contributed to the improvement. However,  the country's ranking declined in business efficiency and government efficiency.

pal-cargo-unveils-ambitious-growth-plans-despite-tariff-threats	PAL Cargo unveils ambitious growth plans despite tariff threats	Flag carrier Philippine Airlines (PAL) has relaunched its cargo service to stay in tune with the latest developments in the cargo industry, amid the impending threat of tariff policies that could disrupt global trade.\nDuring a media launch on Monday, June 16, the Lucio Tan-led airline unveiled the revitalized look for PAL Cargo, with a new focus on digital innovation, broader reach, and tailored logistics solutions.\nHitting the proverbial reset button, according to newly minted PAL President Richard Nuttall, is part of the airline’s effort to “refresh” the cargo service.\nHe said this is particularly vital due to potential headwinds arising from the planned reimplementation of the United States’ (US) tariff policy, which will impact the industry in particular.\nNext month, the so-called reciprocal tariffs will likely be reimplemented, adding higher taxes on goods coming into the US.\nIf the tariff rates, as originally announced, are kept, the Philippines will face a 17-percent levy.\nWhile this will inevitably spell trouble for the cargo industry, the country’s flag carrier is upbeat that PAL Cargo will continue to be robust despite the US being its top market.\nPAL Vice President for Cargo Jason Siy acknowledged that while cargo is a volatile business, it is resilient to disruption or delay.\nSiy recalled that cargo only slowed down for a “couple of days” when the US tariffs were initially imposed, and it has maintained a strong trajectory since.\nIn the first quarter of the year, PAL saw its revenues from cargo rise by six percent to ₱2.04 billion, from ₱1.92 billion in the prior year, carrying 52.6 million kilograms of cargoes.\nOn track to surpass the ₱9.16 billion in revenues recorded last year, Siy said the cargo business is expected to exceed the amount by five to 10 percent this year. This will potentially raise its contribution to PAL’s net income from five percent to eight to nine percent.\nTo reach the goal, PAL is introducing new offerings to its cargo service, such as port-to-door service, which will tap delivery providers to deliver cargoes directly to consignees.\nThe airline is also planning to integrate its frequent flyer program, Mabuhay Miles, to PAL Cargo, allowing customers to earn miles for their cargo transactions.\nLikewise, it is set to introduce a mobile application to provide a more seamless access to the service.\nPAL Cargo offers a wide range of freight services tailored to individual, corporate, and freight forwarders’ needs.\nIt transports varied types of cargoes, including high-value commodities, pharmaceuticals, e-commerce, perishables, and pets, among others.

It slid to eighth place in 2021 and fell further to 10th in 2022.\n“Within ASEAN [the Association of Southeast Asian Nations], the Philippines and Thailand have dropped, due to weaker public finances and savings-investment balances,” DBS explained.\nDBS noted that the Philippines has a savings-investment—or more popularly known as current account—deficit equivalent to 3.8 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2024.\nThe current account deficit stood at $17.5 billion last year—bigger than the $12.4 billion, or 2.8 percent of GDP, in 2023.\nThe Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) had projected the current account deficit would widen further to $19.8 billion, or 3.9 percent of GDP, this year.\nThe latest BSP data released last week showed that the current account deficit doubled to $4.2 billion in the first quarter of 2025 from $2.1 billion a year ago, as the jump in merchandise imports surpassed exports growth.\nAs such, the current account deficit’s share to GDP rose to 3.7 percent at end-March from 1.9 percent a year ago.\nThe Philippines’ other metrics earned green marks from DBS: foreign exchange (forex) reserves equivalent to 19.7 percent of GDP; a fiscal deficit equivalent to four percent of GDP; a private debt-to-GDP ratio of 53.4 percent; a general government debt-to-GDP ratio of 57.1 percent; and an external debt ratio of 29.8 percent.\nIn ASEAN, the Philippines’ 2024 ranking was below Vietnam’s fifth place, Indonesia’s ninth, and Thailand’s 10th, but better than Malaysia’s 21st place.\nThe best-performing EMs in DBS’ 27-country macro risk analysis for 2024 were Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Peru, Russia, and Vietnam.\n“EM Asia looks fairly healthy: Taiwan, South Korea, and the major Southeast Asian economies (Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines) have some of the best scores in the region. Taiwan has consistently led EM rankings, due to high savings-investment surpluses, which contributed to robust reserves, alongside low government and external debt, despite high private debt,” DBS said.\nOn the other hand, DBS said that “China, India, and Malaysia rank lower due to their weaker fiscal metrics, notably government debt, and high private debt.” India ranked 16th, while China was in 17th position.\n“However, China and India have healthy external finances, partially offsetting their fiscal weaknesses, while Malaysia’s vulnerabilities are partly mitigated by sustained domestic demand, and ongoing structural business and fiscal reforms,” DBS added.\nAcross EMs, DBS said that “vulnerability indicators have worsened in recent years, as the debt position, cover for foreign obligations, and savings-investment balance have slipped in many countries.”	"\\tImages/philippines-ballooning-current-account-deficit-flagged_1.png,Images/philippines-ballooning-current-account-deficit-flagged_2.png"	The Philippines' current account deficit is ballooning, placing it 11th among 27 emerging markets in a DBS Bank risk assessment.  The deficit doubled to $4.2 billion in Q1 2025,  with imports exceeding exports. DBS notes weaker public finances and savings-investment balances as contributing factors.  Other metrics, however, received positive assessments from DBS.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/18/philippines-ballooning-current-account-deficit-flagged
psei-rebounds-on-de-escalation-hopes-strong-overseas-remittances	PSEi rebounds on de-escalation hopes, strong overseas remittances	The Philippine Stock Exchange index (PSEi) recovered the previous day’s loss on more substantial remittance numbers as well as hopes that the Israel-Iran conflict will de-escalate.\nThe main index added 10.61 points or 0.17 percent to close at 6,3699.19. Industrials led the advance while Banks lagged. Volume declined to 2.11 billion shares worth P5.94 billion as gainers beat losers 124 to 82, with 42 unchanged.\n“Philippine and US stocks rebounded as hopes grew that the Israel-Iran conflict would stay contained, easing oil price concerns,” said Regina Capital Development Corporation Managing Director Luis Limlingan.\nPhilstocks Financial Research Manager Japhet Tantiangco said, “The local market bounced with positive cues from Wall Street, helping in the climb. Investors also digested the Philippines' overseas Filipinos' cash remittance data for April which posted a 4.0 percent growth.”\nRizal Commercial Banking Corporation Chief Economist Michael L. Ricafort said the PSEi was higher ahead of the possible -0.25 BSP rate cut on Thursday, June 19, 2025 that could further reduce borrowing costs/funding costs by listed companies, consumers, institutions and other borrowers in the economy.\nAlso contributing to positive sentiment is the faster year-on-year growth in the latest OFW remittances data and reports that Iran signaled that it would like to de-escalate the conflict with Israel and willingness to resume nuclear talks with the US.	"\\tImages/psei-rebounds-on-de-escalation-hopes-strong-overseas-remittances_1.png"	The PSEi gained 10.61 points (0.17%) closing at 6,3699.19, recovering from previous losses.  Positive sentiment stemmed from stronger-than-expected overseas remittances showing 4.0% growth in April.  Hopes for de-escalation in the Israel-Iran conflict also boosted the market.  Positive cues from Wall Street and a potential BSP rate cut further contributed to the rebound.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/17/psei-rebounds-on-de-escalation-hopes-strong-overseas-remittances

philippine-government-front-loaded-domestic-borrowings-in-first-quarter-of-2025-adb	Philippine government front-loaded domestic borrowings in first quarter of 2025—ADB	Peso-denominated bonds issued by the Philippine public and private sectors climbed at the start of the year, as both the government and private corporations increasingly tapped the domestic commercial debt market for their financing requirements.\nData from the Asian Development Bank's (ADB) latest Asia Bond Monitor report for June 2025 showed that the local currency (LCY) bond market grew 4.1 percent quarter-on-quarter to ₱13.5 trillion at end-March 2025, reversing the 0.6-percent decline in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n“Growth was steered by a rebound in treasury and other government bonds, which rose 4.1 percent quarter-on-quarter due to increased government borrowing. Meanwhile, central bank securities posted the fastest rate of expansion among all bond types at 15.3 percent quarter-on-quarter, reversing the 11.7-percent quarter-on-quarter contraction in the previous quarter,” noted the ADB report, published last Monday, June 16.\nHowever, the ADB said the stock of corporate bonds shrank by 2.8 percent quarter-on-quarter during the same period as a high volume of securities matured.\nThe LCY bond market was also boosted by new issuances, which increased by 13.7 percent quarter-on-quarter to ₱2.7 trillion in the first quarter.\n“Growth was largely driven by government bond issuance, which surged 98.8 percent quarter-on-quarter as the government front-loaded its borrowing for the year,” the ADB said.\nThe Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) plans to borrow a gross amount of ₱2.04 trillion through the issuance of T-bills and fixed-rate treasury bonds in 2025. Including foreign borrowings, the government had programmed to raise ₱2.55 trillion in debt this year.\nThe Philippine government borrows more from the liquid domestic debt market—and in the local currency—mainly through the weekly issuance of treasury bills and bonds, not only to take advantage of creditors here who are awash in cash but also to temper foreign exchange (forex) risks.\nJust like the public sector, private firms also ramped up their bond issuances, which jumped 20.6 percent quarter-on-quarter during the first quarter—a reversal of the 63.3-percent drop in the fourth quarter of last year.\n“Corporate issuers sought funds to refinance their maturing debt,” the ADB explained.\nThe ADB noted that Sy family-led SM Prime Holdings Inc. was the biggest corporate bond issuer during the period January to March 2025, as the ₱25 billion in IOUs it raised accounted for over a third of the private sector's total first-quarter fund-raising.\nAs for bond yields, the ADB cited that these were “mixed” between early March and late May.\n“Yields at the short-end (one to three months) and long-end (seven years and longer) of the curve rose an average of 17 basis points (bps), largely tracking the yield movements of United States (US) Treasuries,” it noted.\n“In contrast, yields for maturities of six months to five years fell an average of seven bps, driven by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas' (BSP) 25-basis point (bp) rate cut on April 10,” it added.\nFor longer bond tenors, “the decline in yields was also influenced by the BSP's shift toward a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support growth amid external challenges, fueling market expectations of more rate cuts this year,” it said. The BSP is widely anticipated to again cut the key interest rate by 25 bps—to 5.25 percent from the current 5.5 percent>>—when its Monetary Board decides on the policy stance on Thursday, June 19.\nWhile the Philippine bond market continues to grow, the ADB cited that sustainable bond issuances were not catching up as fast.\n“The Philippines' sustainable bond market is among the smallest in emerging East Asia, comprising only two percent of the region's total,” the ADB noted.\nAt the end of the first quarter, total outstanding sustainable bonds reached $13.6-billion worth, up 20.6 percent quarter-on-quarter.\nThe Philippines' sustainable debt stock is 55-percent comprised of government-issued bonds, including the $1-billion worth, euro-denominated sustainability bonds last February.\nAlso, more than 70 percent of these sustainable financing instruments are denominated in foreign currencies.

Government bond issuance surged 98.8 percent quarter-on-quarter.  The rise was driven by increased government borrowing and a rebound in treasury bonds. Private firms also increased bond issuances, mainly for debt refinancing.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/17/philippine-government-front-loaded-domestic-borrowings-in-first-quarter-of-2025adb
philippine-peso-leads-regional-losses-vs-us-dollar-amid-israel-iran-tensions	Philippine peso leads regional losses vs. US dollar amid Israel-Iran tensions	The Philippine peso has depreciated the most among regional currencies against the safe haven United States (US) dollar so far since Israel attacked Iran and heightened global oil price risks.\nA June 18 report by Japanese financial giant MUFG Bank Ltd. showed that since June 13, the peso weakened versus the greenback by 1.4 percent, outpacing the depreciation of the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Indian rupee, Singaporean dollar, Malaysian ringgit, Thai baht, Indonesian rupiah, Chinese yuan in offshore markets (CNH), and Vietnamese dong.\nMUFG Global Markets Research senior currency analyst Lloyd Chan said this broad weakening across most Asian currencies was “driven by risk aversion and rising oil prices.”\n“Oil prices have surged by up to 10 percent, while a prolonged conflict in the Middle East could further hurt global risk sentiment,” Chan said.\nOn the other hand, Chan noted that “the US dollar has strengthened due to safe-haven flows following last Friday’s escalation, amid rising market concerns about potential direct US involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict.”\nFor Chan, “geopolitical developments in the Middle East region will continue to drive FX [foreign exchange] moves across Asia” moving forward.\nOn June 17, MUFG Global Markets Research senior currency analyst Michael Wan said that “the oil-sensitive Asian currencies with current account deficits such as the Indian rupee and Philippine peso have continued to underperform” at the start of the week, amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran.\nThe latest Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) data released last week showed that the Philippines’ deficit in its current account, or net dollar earnings, doubled to $4.2 billion in the first quarter of 2025 from $2.1 billion a year ago, as goods imports growth outpaced the increase in export revenues.\nThe Philippines is a net importer of the goods it consumes. Economists are bracing for a surge of products coming from China—already the top source of Philippine imports for many years now—as Chinese exporters look for alternative markets other than the US amid renewed trade tensions between Beijing and Washington.\nThe government had partly blamed the dismal 5.4-percent year-on-year GDP growth in the first quarter to the “very sharp increase in the trade deficit.”\nBSP data showed that the current account deficit’s share to gross domestic product (GDP) climbed to 3.7 percent at end-March from a year ago’s 1.9 percent.\nThe BSP had projected the current account deficit would further widen to $19.8 billion, or 3.9 percent of GDP, this year.\nLast year, the deficit stood at $17.5 billion, or 3.8 percent of GDP—larger than the $12.4 billion, or 2.8 percent of GDP, in 2023.\nBack in April, the World Bank said that the peso’s gains against the US dollar at the start of this year may be erased by the widening current account deficit amid declining net exports.\nBut while the Philippine peso is currently depreciating at a pace that’s among the worst among emerging market (EM) currencies, most economists believe that the BSP will still push through with the anticipated 25-basis point (bp) cut in key interest rates on Thursday, June 19.	"\\tImages/philippine-peso-leads-regional-losses-vs-us-dollar-amid-israel-iran-tensions_1.png"	The Philippine peso's depreciation against the US dollar is the worst among regional currencies due to Israel-Iran tensions and rising oil prices.  A current account deficit, doubled to $4.2 billion in Q1 2025, is partly to blame.  Economists expect a 25-basis point interest rate cut despite the peso's decline. The widening deficit and increased imports contribute to the peso's weakness.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/18/philippine-peso-leads-regional-losses-vs-us-dollar-amid-israel-iran-tensions

unified-pension-system-a-fix-for-fragmented-philippine-retirement-schemes	Unified pension system: A fix for fragmented Philippine retirement schemes?	With the Philippines’ Social Security System (SSS) receiving a poor rating from a global pension index last year, a finance expert suggested that consolidating all state and private retirement schemes into a unified pension system would be an ideal and more sustainable move for the government.\n“It would be wise to consolidate these various government and private sector retirement schemes and ensure the sustainability of the consolidated defined benefit plan,” Joseph Cherian, CEO, president and dean of Asia School of Business, told Manila Bulletin in an email interview.\nWhy? Too many separate pension programs with different rules, making it so fragmented and difficult to navigate for both the regulators and contributors.\nCherian said changes in regulations would help fix the fragmented system that confuses Filipinos and leads to inefficiencies in “contributions, administration, regulation, as well as unintended overlaps, gaps in coverage, and sustainability risks.”\nHe said the government should review the laws that allowed the system to become “disparate.”\n“Introduce legislation aimed at harmonizing the various retirement schemes,” Cherian said, but noted that “any transition would require careful planning to protect both current and future retirees.”\nIf this reform sounds quite difficult to translate into reality, Cherian said, measures such as shifting the risks from SSS to its contributors. This system works in countries like Singapore and Malaysia, he said.\nBearing the risks\nSSS President and CEO Robert Joseph M. de Claro earlier stated that the state-run pension fund is considering shifting to a variable or hybrid model from its current “defined benefit” mode.\nCherian likened the variable or hybrid model to Singapore’s Central Provident Fund (CPF), wherein an account owner saves in the same way as they would in a “defined contribution” scheme.\nIn this setup, both the employee and the employer regularly contribute to a personal retirement account. The account grows based on contributions and investment returns, with the worker shouldering the risk.\nBy the time one retires, the total savings are converted into regular monthly payouts, similar to a “defined benefit” pension, but based on how much the worker has saved over time.\nMeanwhile, in the “defined benefit” model of the SSS, the pension fund is responsible for ensuring there’s ample funds to pay the promised pension—even if investment returns are low.\nThus, placing the risks upon the government.\nUnder the new setup, contributors would take on more responsibility during the savings period, including understanding how their money is invested.\nBut account holders would have “a full, transparent view of their account values,” Cherian argued. He said this would give them more control to adjust—whether by saving more, delaying retirement, or managing expenses—to secure their future benefits.\nMeanwhile, the SSS fund is expected to last longer under the new model, as payouts will be based on what each member has saved, not a fixed-amount income across all contributors.\nCherian said if investments perform well over time, members could also see higher retirement benefits.\nSlow, steady shift\nWhile Cherian believes a reform is needed, he said any changes to SSS benefits should be carried out “slowly and steadily,” ensuring current members are not negatively affected.\n“First, freeze the SSS plan to new members. Payouts are determined based on account balances,” Cherian suggested.\n“Initially, especially during the early years of the transition, the government may need to subsidize the SSS benefits program to ensure everyone in retirement can enjoy a dignified standard of living,” he further explained.\nHow about the SSS fund life? How long can it last to cover its account holders as it is forecast to last just 28 years—far below the ideal 68 years.\nCherian said there is no “magic panacea” this “especially if the SSS program is grossly underfunded.” In 2023, the pension fund had liabilities of $150.53 billion with assets of just $15.32 billion.\nSuch a massive gap may not sustain the system in the long run. Thus, a reform—and Cherian said the government may also hike its contribution rates. The Marcos administration increased the rates 15 percent earlier this year.\n“Try going higher,” he said, noting that, comparatively, the rate in Singapore can reach as high as 37 percent, with 17 percent coming from the employer and 20 percent from the employee.\nContribution rate in Malaysia can also reach “up to 24 percent in total, with 13 percent contributed by the employer and 11 percent by the employee.”	"\\tImages/unified-pension-system-a-fix-for-fragmented-philippine-retirement-schemes_1.png"	A finance expert proposes consolidating the Philippines' fragmented retirement schemes into a unified system for sustainability.  The current system is confusing and inefficient, with many separate programs and varying rules.  Shifting risks from the SSS to contributors, similar to Singapore and Malaysia's models, is suggested.  This would involve a slow, steady transition, potentially including government subsidies and increased contribution rates.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/05/31/unified-pension-system-a-fix-for-fragmented-philippine-retirement-schemes

psei-drops-ahead-of-fed-bsp-meetings	PSEi drops ahead of Fed, BSP meetings	The PSEi dropped amid see-saw trading this week—volatility is being fed by the Israel-Iran conflict even as investors wait for word from the United States (US) and Philippine central banks, which will hold policy meetings this week.\nThe main index lost 31.76 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 6,337.43. Banks led the retreat, with only the industrial counter bucking the trend. Volume grew to 2.91 billion shares worth ₱5.28 billion, as gainers barely beat losers at 96 to 95, with 52 unchanged.\n“Philippine stocks fell as the Israel-Iran conflict entered its fifth day and US retail sales dropped more than expected, raising concerns about consumer spending,” said Regina Capital Development Corp. managing director Luis Limlingan.\nHe noted that, “While the [US] Fed is expected to hold rates steady, the weak data may support a more dovish stance.”\n“Meanwhile, locals remained on the sidelines as they await the outcome of the latest meeting of the BSP, with many forecasting a rate cut, hoping to ease fears of further conflict escalation in the Middle East,” Limlingan added.\nPhilstocks Financial research manager Japhet Tantiangco said, “The local market pulled back as investors took a cautious stance ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy decision.”\n“Lingering concerns over the Israel-Iran tensions and their economic consequences, primarily on oil prices, also continued to weigh on sentiment,” he added.

sec-sandbox-welcomes-gcash-pluang-ph-to-test-innovative-platforms	SEC Sandbox welcomes GCash, Pluang PH to test innovative platforms	The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved the applications of G-Xchange, Inc. (GCash) and Macodimarc Technology Corporation (Pluang PH) to participate in the Commission’s regulatory sandbox.\nOn June 2, 2025, the SEC formally issued the Notice of Approval for Entry into the SEC Strategic Sandbox (StratBox) to Pluang PH and GCash, allowing them to pilot their platforms in a limited regulatory environment.\nImplemented through SEC Memorandum Circular No. 9, Series of 2024, the SEC StratBox is a regulatory sandbox that allows firms to test innovative products or services in a live but controlled setting, with the goal of eventually offering them to the public at large.\nThe SEC may also grant regulatory relief to sandbox participants by modifying or replacing specific licensing, registration, compliance, or other regulatory requirements that may otherwise apply during the sandbox period, according to the framework.\nIndonesia-based information technology firm Pluang PH will test a mobile application that will allow retail investors in the country to trade and invest in U.S. securities, which have been pre-selected by the applicant and pre-approved by the SEC.\nThese securities are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and/or the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations.\n“Pluang PH, a strategic partnership between Pluang Technologies Singapore and Filinvest Group’s Fdev Digital Innovations and Ventures Inc., aims to democratize access to the global markets for Filipino retail investors.\n“This means that users will be able to buy and sell fractionalized U.S. stocks, enabling investments with as little as one U.S. dollar,” said SEC Chairperson Emilio B. Aquino in his keynote speech during the SEC Stratbox program.\nHe noted that, “After numerous revisions and a rigorous review of their testing plan, Macodimarc Technology Corporation now stands as one of the pioneers to enter the SEC Stratbox. Today, June 02, 2025, marks the official date of their approval to operate within the SEC Strategic Sandbox.”\nThe sandbox of Pluang PH will run for six months, and will involve a controlled group of up to 1,000 qualified buyers and retail users.\nMeanwhile, GCash will seek to provide simplified and unified access to global stock markets within its application through GStocks Global.\n“The journey for G-Xchange Inc. to this pivotal moment began even before their application to PhiliFINNO (SEC’s PhiliFintech Innovation Office). Gcash has been envisioning a similar model back then, long before the sandbox framework was in place. It inspired the SEC to create a regulatory facility to allow the testing of these novel financial products and services,” said Aquino.\nAfter the issuance of the SEC StratBox framework, G-Xchange Inc. submitted its application to the SEC.\n“G-Xchange Inc., the operating company behind GCash, is committed to its vision of ‘Finance for All.’ Through its GStocks Global initiative, G-Xchange Inc. aims to diversify investment options within the GCash app, offering its customers easy, affordable, and seamless access to global stock markets in partnership with EasyEquities, a renowned online investment platform,” Aquino explained.\nThe duration of the sandbox period will be for 24 months, and can admit up to a total of 2 million participants.\nGCash and Pluang PH are required to provide the SEC with regular updates, detailing the progress of their operations, testing outcomes, and issues encountered.\nThe participants are also required to secure the Commission’s approval before changing the testing plan, ensuring oversight and investors’ protection from potential risks.\nThe sandbox could result in three outcomes: successful completion, early termination by the SEC, or voluntary withdrawal by the participant. If successful, the SEC may approve the product for offering to the general public.

Pluang PH will test a mobile app for US securities trading, while GCash will offer global stock market access.  The SEC's StratBox allows firms to test innovative products in a controlled environment.  Successful completion could lead to public product offerings.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/02/sec-sandbox-welcomes-gcash-pluang-ph-to-test-innovative-platforms

sra-seeks-emergency-powers-to-combat-sugar-pest-in-negros	SRA seeks emergency powers to combat sugar pest in Negros	The Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) is seeking emergency powers to contain the spread of red-striped soft scale insects (RSSI) on Negros Island, raising concerns over their potential impact on sugar production and overall supply.\nSRA Deputy Administrator Ignacio Santillana stated that the sugar agency is in dire need of a policy for emergency use to expedite the procurement and distribution of pesticides.\nSantillana said strict regulations of the Commission on Audit (COA) make it difficult for SRA to procure the needed pesticides to curb RSSI swiftly.\n“We currently want to utilize ₱1.5 million for pesticide purchase while we are waiting for the assistance from the Department of Agriculture (DA), but our hands are tied unless there is a policy in place for emergency purchase, and considering the rate of spread, this is an emergency,“ he said.\nThe presence of RSSI was first noted during the tail-end of March in northern Negros Occidental.\nIt was officially declared an infestation on May 22 when it spread over 87 hectares.\nEight days later, the infestation has spread to over 424 hectares, prompting the SRA to seek help from the DA and other government agencies for quarantine measures.\nBased on a study from the National Crop Protection Center (NCPC), at least five insecticides have been confirmed to limit the infestation: buprofezin, dinotefuran, phenthoate, pymetrozine, and thiamethoxam.\nIn a recent inter-government agency meeting, SRA Administrator Pablo Luis Azcona called on sugar mills to strictly monitor the movement of canes and planting materials.\nAzcona earlier stated that RSSI was first observed in Luzon in 2020 and was subsequently contained, only to reappear—this time in Negros Island, which accounts for 60 percent of the country’s total sugar production.\nBased on SRA data, 13 towns and cities in Negros Occidental have reported the presence of RSSI. Mabinay town in Negros Oriental and Anilao town in Panay also reported the pest.\nThe agency, however, is of the belief that the infestation is broader than what is reported. It said the limitations they have in manpower slow down verification efforts.\nAzcona has since asked for assistance from local agriculturists, as well as the Bureau of Plant Industry (BPI), to ensure that the infestation will not spread into other islands.\n“I am confident we can arrest this with the help and cooperation of everyone, but if we don’t, this is hitting the sugar industry at its heart because Negros is also the major source of sugar for the country,” said Azcona.\n“All the more why we need to come up with regulations and policies in place because somebody has to take responsibility for what’s happening now,” he added.\nAzcona said he has sent a letter requesting ₱10 million in assistance from the DA, which was “well-received” by Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel.\nSRA’s research unit has confirmed that high temperature is a key factor in the rapid population increase of RSSI.\nIt is currently exploring the use of natural predators that can attack RSSI, as the use of pesticides would add further production costs to farmers.\nEven then, the sugar agency is still keen on harnessing pesticides, particularly through the potential use of drones for a wider range of applications.\nAzcona said this will be carefully studied, and if proven effective, the private sector will be called on for such equipment.

Strict COA regulations hinder swift pesticide procurement, prompting the SRA to request ₱10 million in assistance from the Department of Agriculture. The infestation, initially observed in March, has rapidly spread across over 424 hectares.  Negros Island, a major sugar producer, faces significant economic risk if the infestation isn't contained.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/02/sra-seeks-emergency-powers-to-combat-sugar-pest-in-negros
unilab-ateneo-lead-push-for-improved-lgu-health-spending	Unilab, Ateneo lead push for improved LGU health spending	In a bold move to reshape how local governments finance healthcare, Unilab Foundation (ULF) through the Unilab Center for Health Policy (UCHP) and Ateneo de Manila University (ADMU) have joined forces to deliver research-backed solutions to improve the fiscal performance of health budgets at the local level—an often overlooked but critical component in achieving Universal Health Care (UHC).\nThe partnership brings together Ateneo’s School of Government (ASoG) and UCHP, with technical collaboration with the Department of Budget and Management (DBM).\nThe study is the first of its kind to focus on optimizing local health spending under the UHC Law across local government units (LGUs).\nDuring the ceremonial signing, Unilab Foundation Executive Director Atty. Jose Maria Ochave cited the broader purpose behind the agreement.\n“Today is not just a ceremonial signing but a small step toward transforming local health governance in the country. We are happy and privileged to partner with the Ateneo School of Government and the Ateneo de Manila University,” he said.\nThe collaboration draws on the strengths of both institutions. UCHP has been working to close gaps in the UHC Law’s implementation, while ASoG trains leaders to tackle real-world problems through policy innovation and public accountability.\nTogether, they aim to combine data-driven policy work with ethical and evidence-based governance. But beyond the numbers and systems, both sides hope to spark a deeper shift in mindset—that good health is not just a policy goal, but a shared responsibility.\nFor Ochave, the mission is clear: this partnership must not only generate knowledge but also empower the institutions that can act on it.\nMaria Luz C. Vilches, PhD, Vice President for Higher Education, Ateneo de Manila University\nEchoing this vision, Ateneo Vice President for Higher Education, Dr. Maria Luz C. Vilches, highlighted a critical yet often overlooked issue: the role of budgeting in achieving health outcomes.\n“This is very important as pointed out about the UHC Law; there’s a lot to do,” she said. “Our noble goal is health insurance, well-being—but we have to attend to the mundane things called budget and money.”\nVilches underscored the critical insight often missing in policy discussions: that realizing the promise of universal healthcare requires more than ideals—it demands willingness to deal with budgetary details head-on.\n“Sometimes the lever does not move if you don't touch the aspects of budget and money. I am happy that this project is going to move that lever,” she further explained.\nBuilding on this, UCHP Program Director Ruben “John” Basa pointed to the depth and scope of their current work—and how it connects directly to this initiative.\n“When you talk of local government, health financing and Ateneo, this is a small room of big ideas,” he said. “We want to research and demonstrate how the UHC Law can be implemented one LGU at a time.”\nUCHP has already laid important groundwork. Last year, it completed four studies—two national and two local—on critical UHC reforms. These included a review of PhilHealth’s shift to a new provider payment mechanism, the rollout of the Konsulta outpatient package, and the development of a service delivery model for geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas (GIDA), which will be pilot-tested in Ormoc City.\nBasa also shared findings from UCHP’s landmark 30-year review of national health accounts, a project that revealed stark contrasts in health financing trends.\n“In 1992, the out-of-pocket spending of the Philippines was at 47 percent, Thailand was at 45 percent,” Basa said. “Fast forward to 2023, the Philippines’ out-of-pocket spending went down to 45 percent, Thailand to 9.2 percent. They must be doing something good over there.”\nThe same study found that despite increased funding, local government spending on health was “falling to irrelevance.” That troubling trend only underscores the urgent need for reform—precisely what this new initiative seeks to address.\nPhilip Arnold P. Tuaño PhD, Dean, Ateneo School of Government\nClosing the event, Philip Arnold Tuaño, Dean of ASoG, reinforced the critical role of industry leaders in strengthening public healthcare systems. He stressed the need for close monitoring of the fiscal performance of LGUs to ensure that every peso spent leads to tangible improvements in services and infrastructure.\nAccording to Tuaño, the partnership with Unilab Foundation will also generate research and data that can guide both national and local decision-makers.\n“Today formalizes a partnership with the common vision of pursuit of equitable, accessible, and effective healthcare for the Philippines,” Tuaño said.

the-silent-sell-off-of-foreign-re-investors	The silent sell-off of foreign RE investors	The 'hotness' of the Philippines for renewable energy investments may be losing its sizzle. Some foreign investors are now quietly slipping out the back door, leaving behind whispers of uncertainty, a trail of unanswered questions about what went wrong, and a half-empty plate of missed opportunities.\nThe grapevine is buzzing that one big-ticket foreign investor, now stealthily selling its stake in the floating solar space, was once paraded as a headline deal from President Marcos’ 2023 state visit to an ASEAN neighbor-country.\n"They are already negotiating with the buyer, and the agreement is expected to be signed soon. The buyer-company is led by a former executive of a subsidiary of a giant power utility in the country," a source revealed.\nOne major European investor in the offshore wind sector, despite the massive-scale service contracts it cornered from the Department of Energy (DOE), is now actively hunting for buyers. Insiders say it's not just an internal organizational shake-up driving its exit, but mainly growing frustration over the Philippines’ unpredictable policy game.\nIn fact, even other RE players who were once eager to go all-in under the 100 percent foreign ownership policy for solar and wind are now backing down and unloading shares. They are troubled by grid integration concerns and the maze of red tape at local government permitting, which has turned the investment landscape into a bureaucratic obstacle course.\nEase of doing business?\nAt a recent solar industry technical workshop, the real talk at the lunch table wasn’t about RE technologies — it was about survival. Both foreign and local investors bluntly admitted that navigating the Philippine investment terrain means playing by the rules imposed by most local government units (LGUs) — where unreceipted 'facilitation payments' are business as usual, some local officials moonlight as land brokers, and developers are tactically manipulated into sourcing materials from politically-connected subcontractors or suppliers just to keep projects moving.\n"Sadly, that’s the real ‘ease of doing business’ in this country — grease or get stuck," one industry source frustratingly said. They added that foreign investors, bound by strict anti-bribery laws back home, often bail out the moment they spot the red flags waving across the Philippine investment scene.\nAnother multinational European investor also judiciously walked away from its offshore wind ambitions last year. While the local partner dressed it up as a "shares acquisition," sources from the foreign firm divulged that "we pulled out because we’ve already assessed that the project’s environmental impact on biodiversity would be a dealbreaker."\nTo this day, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) still hasn't finalized the 'no-go zones' for offshore wind, despite repeated warnings that several DOE-awarded service contracts may overlap with protected and biodiversity-rich areas in the Batangas-Mindoro corridor, leaving investors in the dark about where they can build and where they're not even supposed to set foot.\nFundamentally, the ‘no-go zones’ should be incorporated into the marine spatial planning (MSP) for the offshore wind industry. These will demarcate prohibited zones due to safety, environmental, technical, or regulatory reasons, including those on shipping lanes or navigational channels, protected marine areas, fishing zones, military zones, and sites with extreme seabed conditions that would make construction unfeasible.\nGiven that even some green-lane certified RE foreign investors are already eyeing exit, the incoming Energy Secretary — who is highly expected to be Undersecretary Sharon Garin — faces a ticking clock and immediate heavy load: act fast or watch the country bleed the investment dollars that the Marcos administration had largely brandished as accomplishments of his previous state and working visits.\nRegulatory gridlock\nApart from the tricky concerns of permitting, RE investors live and die by return on investment (ROI). That’s the reason why most of them shunned the 2nd green energy auction in 2023 — as the reserve prices set by the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) were seen tanking hopes of hitting the returns investors demand.\nAt its core, the message of the investors has been loud and clear: poorly designed green energy auction reserve (GEAR) tariffs would be the deal-killer because they don’t only undermine investor confidence, they could choke financing. And when that happens, investors would have no choice but to turn away and place their money somewhere else.\nIn the preliminary GEA-4 price calculations released by the ERC in April, prospective bidders are already howling over dead-on-arrival returns, especially for floating solar and IRESS. This is already prompting an early signal for them to back off on planned capital injection.\nBeyond permitting nightmares and ROI headaches, adding to the investors’ jitters is the 'bold reset' on the Cabinet reshuffle currently being enforced by the Marcos administration, because this could suddenly change policy actors and may also rewrite industry rules overnight.\nEven the ERC chief had been sent a Palace memo to quit her post, although it is widely talked about in industry circles that Chairperson Monalisa Dimalanta has not submitted her resignation yet, because she’s asking all the other Commissioners to also tender their respective resignations along with her.\nThese chaotic developments – including apprehensions on whether or not leadership at the ERC shall also be replaced — have been placing investors on edge. So don’t be shocked when the floodgates open and they start bailing in droves, because when confidence cracks, the smart money doesn’t just wait around.\nFor feedback and suggestions, please email at: myrnamvelasco@gmail.com	"\\tImages/the-silent-sell-off-of-foreign-re-investors_1.png"	Foreign renewable energy investors are leaving the Philippines due to uncertainty and challenges.  Issues include unpredictable policies, bureaucratic hurdles, and the need for unofficial payments.  Poorly designed green energy auction reserve tariffs also undermine investor confidence. The incoming Energy Secretary faces a critical need to address these issues to prevent further investment losses.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/09/the-silent-sell-off-of-foreign-re-investors

peso-teeters-near-57-mark-amid-iran-israel-conflict	Peso teeters near ₱57 mark amid Iran-Israel conflict	The peso is facing renewed pressure against the US dollar, nearly reaching the ₱57 level, just three trading days after slipping back to the ₱56 mark.\nAmid heightened market anxiety surrounding the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, the peso continued its sharp depreciation on Wednesday, June 18, shedding 28 centavos against the US dollar to close at its intraday low of ₱56.98.\nThe local currency reached an intraday high of ₱56.7 after opening at ₱56.75, according to the Bankers Association of the Philippines (BAP).\nTotal trading volume inched up to $1.266 billion from Tuesday's $1.203 billion.\nAccording to Michael Ricafort, the US dollar-peso exchange rate climbed for the seventh consecutive trading day, hitting its highest level in over two months since April 14, 2025, when it ended at ₱57.08:$1.\nRicafort said this trend came amid the risk that the Israel-Iran war “could escalate and the US could be dragged into the conflict, with global crude oil prices at new 4.5-month highs lately.”\nHe added this conflict also triggered risk aversion and a flight to safe-haven assets such as the US dollar.\nWhile the greenback slightly rebounded to one-week lows against major global currencies after recently hitting three-year highs, gains versus Asian and ASEAN currencies, including the Philippines, remain modest—helping limit further pressure on the peso.\nMeanwhile, global crude oil prices have climbed to a four-and-a-half month high of $74 per barrel (Nymex benchmark), raising concerns over a higher oil import bill for the Philippines, which relies heavily on imported fuel.\nRicafort further said that the local currency also faced pressure ahead of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas’ (BSP) policy meeting on Thursday, June 19.\nA 25 basis-point (bp) cut is widely expected, a move that could narrow the interest rate differential with the US Federal Reserve to just 75 percent, the lowest in nearly two years, last seen in late 2023, the economist noted.

on-handling-money-and-financial-confidence	On handling money and financial confidence	Psalm 24:1 states, “The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it.”\nLast May, WomenBiz Director Alpha Allanigui invited me to speak to the Super Moms group on money and finance, a topic I'd like to share here.\nMoney deeply affects our emotions. We feel happy when we have it and worried when we don't. Yet, money itself is actually powerless and neutral. It only does what its holder directs it to do.\nGod is the ultimate owner of everything, including our lives, resources, and possessions. We are not owners but rather stewards, entrusted to manage these resources with wisdom and integrity.\nHow can we achieve financial confidence?\nLive within your means/save\nA common pitfall is attempting to “keep up with the Santos’s.” We must resist this urge. Evaluate your lifestyle. Are your purchases driven by wants rather than needs? Before any purchase, ask yourself if you truly need it. Avoid impulse buying. Remember, when you buy something costing ₱1,000 on sale for 30% off, you haven't saved ₱300; you've spent ₱700. Spend wisely. I highly recommend reading “The Millionaire Next Door”; it illustrates how truly wealthy individuals live simply and don’t flaunt their money. As the saying goes, “Acting rich is how you go broke; acting broke is how you become rich.”\nTeach kids early on the value of money\n* Provide a weekly allowance rather than a daily one to teach them money management.\n* Open a bank account for them so they can watch their money grow.\n* Consider matching their savings!\n* Talk openly about money.\nSave Consistently, Like a Habit and a Lifestyle. Have a clear goal. Just because you can afford something doesn't mean you should buy it.\nStill feel like you don't have enough? Do you truly know how much money you earn? What's your spending pattern? Do you keep records?\nKnow your financial situation and keep records\n* Income Statement: Track your revenue (how much you made) and expenses (how much you spent); the difference is your income.\n* Cash Flow: Monitor what cash comes in versus what goes out. Your salary may arrive monthly, but expenses are daily. What cash came in? How was it spent? How much of your income is regular versus non-recurring? What about expenses—how much is fixed and how much is variable? Crucially, what comes in should always be greater than what goes out; otherwise, that’s deficit spending, which you must guard against.\n* Balance Sheet: Assets are what you own (cash, house and lot, etc.), and liabilities are what you owe (credit card debt, loans, etc.). The difference is your net worth. It's vital that your assets exceed your liabilities, or your net worth becomes negative.\nExpand your means\nOur greatest weapon is our mind; train it to see opportunities, not obstacles. Examine your personal assets and liabilities, your unique qualities. Are you a self-starter or a procrastinator? Are you personable with an excellent network, or are you aloof? What is your passion? Your strengths? Know your God-given talents and use your gifts well. Tutoring, gardening, baking, cooking, crafts—these are all potential income streams to add to your current sources.\nGod is the creator of all wealth, a God of ideas. He knows where the gold is. Let's allow Him to show us! Dream big—it's free. Set a timeline and action steps to make your dreams a reality. In life, we will encounter setbacks and failures; use these as learning experiences and start again.\nInvest\nInvesting means putting money to use in something that offers profitable returns, accepting some risk with the prospect of earning more. This is distinct from gambling or speculation, as the safety of the principal is paramount. You can put your money in a bank, invest in bonds, shares of stocks, real estate, and so on. You must understand your risk profile: higher returns often mean higher risk. Find a balance that aligns your financial goals with your risk tolerance. Learn the beauty of compounding interest (where you earn interest on top of interest earned from prior periods) and let it work for you. It's not so much what you have, but what you do with what you have, that truly counts.\nGive\nTo give is to share our blessings and acknowledge that God will provide. The act of giving invites God’s supernatural intervention into our lives and finances—that kind of power is too awesome to miss. However, guard against giving indiscriminately. Always pray for discernment.\nLive within your means. Spend wisely. Save regularly. Invest carefully. And GIVE, for we cannot outgive God. He owns everything and is in control. Philippians 4:19 reminds us: “My God will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.”\nFinally, money isn’t everything. Health is wealth. True wealth lies in peace, joy, contentment, and strong family relationships. Count your blessings, and in everything, give thanks.\nMs. Tarriela is a banker, environmentalist, and gardener.	"\\tImages/on-handling-money-and-financial-confidence_1.png"	Achieve financial confidence by living within your means, saving consistently, and teaching kids the value of money early.  Track income, expenses, and net worth to understand your financial situation. Expand your income streams using your skills and talents, and invest wisely while understanding your risk tolerance.  Finally, remember to give generously, knowing God will provide.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/19/on-handling-money-and-financial-confidence
philippines-still-lags-most-asean-peers-in-foreign-investments	Philippines still lags most ASEAN peers in foreign investments	The Philippines posted a substantial increase in net inflows of foreign direct investments (FDIs) last year, even as it held on to the sixth spot among Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) members for the fourth consecutive year, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).\nBased on its 2025 World Investment Report launched on Thursday, June 19, UNCTAD said the Philippines saw FDI net inflows surge 38.5 percent to $8.94 billion in 2024 from $6.45 billion in the previous year.\nDespite the increase, the Philippines remained the sixth highest in ASEAN in terms of value of net FDI inflows—a ranking the country has kept since 2021. In 2019 and 2020, it ranked a notch higher, at fifth place.\nUNCTAD data showed that Singapore took the top spot in net inflows in 2024, with $143.35 billion.\nRounding off the top five are Indonesia ($24.21 billion), Vietnam ($20.17 billion), Malaysia ($11.26 billion), and Thailand ($10.58 billion).\nUNCTAD cited the five countries for powering FDI growth across ASEAN, as the 10-member bloc reported a total of $225 billion in net inflows last year, up 10 percent from $205 billion in 2023.\nThe Philippines was only able to surpass Cambodia ($4.4 billion), Myanmar ($1.1 billion), Laos ($988 million), and Brunei Darussalam ($26 million). Timor Leste, which is applying to be an ASEAN member, reported $247 million.\nWhile ASEAN remained an attractive destination for foreign capital, Asia as a whole saw FDI net inflows fall three percent to $605 billion in 2024 from $622 billion in the prior year.\nAt the global level, inflows dipped 11 percent to $1.53 trillion last year from $1.64 trillion in 2023—its second straight year of contraction.\nFor this year, UNCTAD is expecting a more negative outlook for global FDI despite initial expectations of “modest growth” at the start of the year.\nIt noted that its previously positive forecast has since been “overtaken by rising economic and policy uncertainty.”\n“The escalation of a new tariff war, along with deteriorating investor sentiment, has led to downward revisions in key FDI determinants: global GDP [gross domestic product] growth, capital formation, trade and exchange rate stability,” the report read.\nUNCTAD particularly highlighted the new tariff policy of the United States (US), which includes the imposition of a baseline 10-percent tariff on incoming goods, as well as the much higher reciprocal tariffs.\nSuspended until next month, the US government slapped tariffs against its key trading partners to supposedly address unfair trade practices and protect domestic industries.\nWhile negotiations between the Philippine government and the US could still change the tariff rate, the country is currently set to face a 17-percent tax.\n“The escalation of global trade tensions over the past year—driven by reciprocal tariff measures, evolving trade negotiations and heightened economic policy uncertainty—has significantly reshaped the landscape for international investment,” UNCTAD said.\nIt stated that these tensions will likely dampen global economic and trade growth, with substantial spillovers to global FDI flows.\nOn top of this dim outlook for the year, UNCTAD has also flagged the sharp decline in international project finance (IPF), which are investments critical for large-scale infrastructure and development.\nBased on UNCTAD data, IPF projects declined by 27 percent from 2,713 in 2023 to 1,988 in 2024.\nIn terms of value, IPF stood at $909 billion last year, down 26 percent from $1.23 trillion in the previous year.\nIn Asia, the number of projects fell by 27 percent, with the total value dropping by a steep 43 percent.\n“This disproportionate decline suggests that the global downturn in IPF deals is affecting emerging markets more severely, due to higher risk perceptions and elevated capital costs, with negative implications for investment in infrastructure and the energy transition,” the report read.\nUNCTAD said the decline in the value of IPF deals was most pronounced in ASEAN, with the Philippines sliding 61 percent.\nThis spells trouble for the Philippines as the majority of its infrastructure projects, particularly in the transportation sector, rely on foreign financing.\nUNCTAD is calling on policymakers to take on “bold reforms and coordinated action” to reverse the global downturn in FDI and IPF.\n“Only by reshaping the rules and incentives that guide global capital can countries unlock leapfrog opportunities and turn today’s volatility into tomorrow’s development gains,” it said.

philippines-ups-ranking-to-76th-in-wefs-energy-transition-index	Philippines ups ranking to 76th in WEF's Energy Transition Index	As it aspires to increase the share of renewable energy (RE) in its power mix, the Philippines drastically improved its ranking to 76th out of 118 countries in the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) 2025 Energy Transition Index (ETI). This year’s jump is a reversal of the country’s slide to 105th out of 120 countries in the 2024 ETI, from its previous position of 94th in 2023. WEF’s ETI is used to evaluate countries’ recent efforts toward improving energy security. In the latest ETI, the Philippines was grouped under emerging Asia, a region that has shown progress through reforms, infrastructure improvements, and increased investments in clean energy. According to Geneva, Switzerland-based WEF, the Philippines received an ETI score of 53, placing it ninth within the emerging Asia group, which has an average ETI score of 53.2. Most of its Southeast Asian neighbors, such as Malaysia (ranked 47th), Vietnam (49th), Thailand (51st), Singapore (52nd), Indonesia (58th), and Cambodia (73rd), recorded higher ETI scores than the Philippines. Only Laos and Brunei Darussalam placed lower. Within the emerging Asia group, China ranked the highest, placing 12th overall. The Philippines continues its pursuit to reach 35-percent RE by 2030, and 50 percent by 2040. However, progress has been slightly uneven, with recent reports of some international investors showing reluctance to proceed with their RE plans in the country. Juan Paolo Colet, analyst and managing director at Chinabank Capital Corp., explained to Manila Bulletin that there is a slight hesitation coming from RE sponsors, stating that “a recurring concern that appears to be holding back the full potential of our energy sector is grid capacity and infrastructure. We need to accelerate the expansion and modernization of the grid as part of a national strategy of ensuring sustainable energy security.” Despite this, Colet is positive that the country is still well-positioned to accelerate its RE scale-up. “I think Philippine energy policy is on the right track, and what is important is sustaining the momentum. There is strong investment interest in RE development, and domestic banks are ready to provide the necessary financing for bankable projects,” he said. Global progress slows down despite RE push Globally, WEF saw an increased adoption of RE, alongside stable energy prices, subsidy cuts, and improvements in energy efficiency. However, despite these advancements, global energy security slowed as nations saw inflexible power systems, import dependence, and limited diversification of energy sources. WEF said that the ETI saw the fastest progress prior to pandemic levels, as 65 percent of countries have improved, with Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Norway, and Switzerland taking the lead in commendable energy policies, infrastructure, and clean energy diversification. Roberto Bocca, head of Center for Energy and Materials at WEF, shared that 28 percent of countries, such as Brazil, China, the United States (US), and Nigeria, have advanced their energy systems. While there has been a 1.1-percent marginal record growth in the ETI, WEF pointed to a significant stagnation in world energy security, citing higher emissions driven by artificial intelligence (AI), data centers, cooling, and electrification. “Despite $2 trillion in clean energy investment in 2024, emissions hit a record 37.8 billion tons in the hottest year on record, as energy demand rose 2.2 percent,” it explained. According to Muqsit Ashraf, group chief executive at Accenture Strategy, AI has become transformative in terms of a more intelligent, adaptive, and resilient energy future. “Leading companies are harnessing technology, data, and AI to accelerate their reinvention and placing people at the core of that change—ultimately becoming more resilient and delivering long-term profitable growth,” he said. To further encourage nations to improve their energy systems, WEF called for adaptive policies that attract capital and cooperation, modernized infrastructure, workforce skill investments, clean technology deployments, and increasing capital investments in developing economies.	"\\tImages/philippines-ups-ranking-to-76th-in-wefs-energy-transition-index_1.png"	The Philippines significantly improved its ranking in the WEF's 2025 Energy Transition Index, rising to 76th out of 118 countries.  This improvement follows a previous decline, showcasing progress in renewable energy efforts.  However, grid capacity and infrastructure remain concerns, hindering the full potential of the energy sector. Despite challenges, the country aims to reach 35% renewable energy by 2030 and 50% by 2040.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/19/philippines-ups-ranking-to-76th-in-wefs-energy-transition-index
peso-drops-to-571-ahead-of-anticipated-bsp-interest-rate-cut	Peso drops to ₱57:$1 ahead of anticipated BSP interest rate cut	The peso dropped to the ₱57 level against the United States (US) dollar on Thursday morning, June 19, ahead of the expected Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) interest rate cut later in the day.\nAccording to the Bankers Association of the Philippines (BAP), the local currency opened at ₱57.1, weaker by 12 centavos than Wednesday’s close of ₱56.98.\nAs of 12 noon, the peso fell to a low of ₱57.41.\n“Higher oil prices is Philippine peso-negative,” said Deepali Bhargava, Asia-Pacific regional research head at Dutch financial giant ING, in a June 18 report.\nING projected the peso spot trade to reach ₱57.04:$1, even as it could appreciate to ₱56 over the next month, ₱56.5 over the next quarter, ₱56 over the next semester, and then return to the ₱57 level over the next 12 months.\n“The Philippine peso underperformed the region last month and fell 0.7 percent against the US dollar. The recent spike above ₱56 has been driven by higher oil prices as the Philippines is one of the worst impacted given it’s a large oil importer,” ING said.\nThe peso dropped to the ₱56 level just last Friday, June 13, after Israel attacked Iran.\n“Our estimates indicate that a 10-percent increase in oil prices can add 0.25 percent of GDP [gross domestic product] to the current account deficit, which will be a negative for the currency in the near term,” ING added.\nAccording to ING, “from a valuation perspective, the Philippine peso remains overvalued on a real effective exchange rate basis with the weakest current account balance in the region.”\nSingapore’s DBS Bank Ltd. had also flagged the Philippines’ wider deficit in its current account, or net dollar earnings.\nThe latest Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) data released last week showed that the Philippines’ current account deficit doubled to $4.2 billion in the first quarter of 2025 from $2.1 billion a year ago, as goods imports growth outpaced the rise in exports.\nThe Philippines is a net importer of the goods it consumes. Economists are bracing for a surge of products coming from China—already the top source of Philippine imports for many years now—as Chinese exporters look for alternative markets other than the US amid renewed trade tensions between Beijing and Washington.\nBSP data showed that the current account deficit’s share to GDP climbed to 3.7 percent at end-March from 1.9 percent a year ago.\nThe BSP had projected the current account deficit would further widen to $19.8 billion, or 3.9 percent of GDP, this year.\nLast year, the deficit stood at $17.5 billion, or 3.8 percent of GDP—larger than the $12.4 billion, or 2.8 percent of GDP, in 2023.\nIn a June 19 report, Japanese financial giant MUFG Bank Ltd. noted that “Asian currencies have broadly extended their losses against the US dollar [last Wednesday], with the Philippine peso leading regional declines, falling 0.5 percent on the day and nearly two percent since Middle East tensions escalated last Friday,” referring to the tensions between Israel and Iran.\nFor ING, its projected 25-basis-point (bp) cut in key interest rates, to lower the BSP’s policy rate to 5.25 percent from the current 5.5 percent, “could add to the Philippine peso’s downside.”\n“Moreover, equity markets remain weak with outflows from FIIs [foreign institutional investors] persisting since November 2024,” ING added.\nMUFG Global Markets Research senior currency analyst Lloyd Chan noted that BSP Governor Eli M. Remolona Jr. had stated that “the central bank will tolerate currency weakness, noting that intervention will be futile amid global risk aversion.”\nMUFG is also looking forward to the market’s widely anticipated 25-bp BSP rate cut, which Chan noted would be “supported by moderating inflation.”\nIn a separate June 19 report, DBS said that the latest interest rate reduction, which brings to 125 bps the cumulative cuts since the BSP started its monetary easing cycle in August last year, “is unlikely to be an easy decision, considering peso’s recent underperformance, concurrent to a lift in oil prices.”\n“The Philippine peso slipped to a two-month low this month, depreciating [about] two percent against the dollar and is one of the regional underperformers this year,” DBS noted.\n“Preferring to preserve their FX [foreign exchange] reserve stock, Governor Remolona said it was futile to intervene strongly in the face of weak risk sentiments benefiting the dollar. Focus, instead, is likely to be on domestic considerations, which lay the ground for further rate reductions,” the Singaporean bank further noted.\nWith a “significant” real rate buffer on the back of slower inflation, plus global uncertainties on the horizon, DBS said the BSP would likely cut interest rates again in the third quarter, or during the Monetary Board’s (MB) Aug. 28 policy-setting meeting, to bring the policy rate down to a “neutral” level of five percent.	"\\tImages/peso-drops-to-571-ahead-of-anticipated-bsp-interest-rate-cut_1.png"	The Philippine peso weakened to ₱57 against the US dollar, influenced by higher oil prices and a projected BSP interest rate cut.  ING projects the peso to reach ₱57.04:$1, citing the Philippines' large oil imports and overvalued currency. The current account deficit doubled to $4.2 billion in Q1 2025, further impacting the peso's value.  The BSP's anticipated rate cut could exacerbate the peso's decline.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/19/peso-drops-to-571-ahead-of-anticipated-bsp-interest-rate-cut

Volume declined to 983 million shares worth P4.43 billion as losers edged out gainers 91 to 90 with 57 unchanged.\n“Philippine shares closed moderately higher ahead of the BSP decision and right after the Fed held rates steady,” said Regina Capital Development Corporation Managing Director Luis Limlingan.\nHe added that, “The committee also signaled two cuts this year, while warning of slower growth and higher inflation… Trump, meanwhile, claimed Iran may send a delegation for talks.”\n“Back home, Philippine shares were bought up before the FTSE rebalancing tomorrow, and amid Middle East tensions and ahead of the BSP’s policy meeting, where the street widely expects a 25bp rate cut,” Limlingan said.\nPhilstocks Financial Research Manager Japhet Tantiangco said “The local market rose on expectations that the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas would cut their policy rates in their Monetary Board meeting today. Investors are also looking forward to the two policy rate cuts that the Federal Reserve has projected for this year.”\nRizal Commercial Banking Corporation Chief Economist Michael L. Ricafort said the PSEi corrected slightly higher ahead of the widely expected 0.25 BSP rate cut to 5.25 percent amid benign inflation as this could further reduce borrowing costs/funding costs by listed companies, consumers, institutions and other borrowers.

upskilling-top-philippine-business-executives-part-1	Upskilling top Philippine business executives, part 1	With the passing of the EBET (Enterprise-Based Education and Training) Law, the focus in human resource management has shifted. No longer are we solely prioritizing lengthy degree courses that often produce graduates lacking market-demanded skills. Instead, attention is now firmly on shorter, more job-oriented upskilling, reskilling, and retooling programs. This is especially true for TESDA-type programs, which President BBM highlighted in his second SONA. He emphasized the need to reshape the K-12 basic education curriculum's senior year away from a college-centric approach towards more skills training in technical schools like Dualtech, Don Bosco, MFI Technical Institute, Cebu's Center for Technology and Enterprise (CITE), and similar TESDA-supervised institutes.\nHowever, it’s important to note that for nearly sixty years, the Center for Research and Communication (CRC), which eventually evolved into the University of Asia and the Pacific (UA&P), has been offering upskilling, reskilling, and retooling programs for business and education professionals. From its inception, CRC's educational programs were designed not to grant college or masteral degrees, but to cultivate the specific skills genuinely demanded by Philippine businesses at every stage of the nation's economic development. The granting of academic degrees was always secondary.\nAt UA&P, we consider the Strategic Business Economics Program (SBEP) to be the upskilling, reskilling, and retooling program par excellence. It addresses the learning needs of the highest leaders in the country, from CEOs of private enterprises to top government officials in the executive and legislative branches. Modesty aside, we have upskilled top officials in the Legislature (members of the House of Representatives and Senators) and the Executive (Cabinet members and the current President himself), in addition to top executives from large and medium-sized enterprises in the Philippines and other Asian countries.\nDuring the first four years of Martial Law in the early seventies, the authoritarian leader started on the right foot by appointing highly qualified technocrats to his Cabinet. These individuals, mostly US-trained with advanced degrees in management, economics, and related fields (such as Armand Fabella, Alejandro Melchor, Gerardo Sicat, Vicente Paterno, Onofre Corpuz, and Jobo Fernandez), set the pace for economic policy formulation and reforms. They were professionalizing government services, increasingly employing scientific tools in crafting monetary, fiscal, trade, industrial, investment, and labor policies to achieve government goals of economic growth, low inflation, and a more equitable distribution of income and wealth.\nAt that time, we had already organized the Friends of CRC to help build and grow the fledgling think tank founded by Dr. Jesus Estanislao in 1967, alongside other professionals from business, academe, and the mass media. Among these Friends of CRC (FOC) were CEOs of leading business enterprises like United Laboratories, Victorias Milling Corporation, Ayala Corporation, Meralco, Philex Mining, Benguet Corporation, Warner Barnes, Smith Bell, and a few others. As we began providing economic briefings to the top management of these FOCs, we realized they needed upskilling and reskilling in macroeconomics (monetary, fiscal, and trade policies), even if they had earned their graduate business degrees from top US schools like Harvard, Wharton, Northwestern, Chicago, and Columbia. The economics courses in their MBA programs proved insufficient to prepare them for the intricacies of policy formulation in a developing country like the Philippines.\nInspired, we designed an upskilling program in macroeconomics and business economics specifically for top executives, which we called the MBE (Master in Business Economics) program. At that nascent stage of CRC, we were fortunate to receive special permission from the Department of Education, through enlightened officials, to grant a masteral degree in any area related to business or industrial economics. Sooner or later, however, we realized that the vast majority of those enrolled in the MBE program were no longer interested in obtaining a master's degree by capping their coursework with a thesis. They simply had no time to write one, and many already held an MBA. In fact, over the more than fifty years of existence of what we renamed the Strategic Business Economics Program (SBEP), less than ten percent of participants chose to write a thesis and obtain the MBE. The vast majority were solely interested in acquiring the additional knowledge and skills gained from participating in the SBEP. As the years progressed, we attracted top officials not only from the business world, but also from all branches of government (executive, legislative, and judiciary), as well as from academic institutions and non-governmental organizations, including the Catholic Church. We are proud to mention that one of the government officials who participated in the SBEP when he was Governor of Ilocos Norte was the current President of the Philippines, President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. The current Secretary of Finance, Ralph Recto, also participated in the same program. Over these last 50 years, we have produced more than 1,000 top executives well-versed in both macroeconomics and business economics.\nFor top and middle-level executives interested in upskilling themselves in macroeconomics and business economics today, let me quote from the UA&P website regarding the nature and purpose of the Strategic Business Economics Program (SBEP). It's a unique executive education program that combines the powerful discipline of economics with the best and cutting-edge business practices, both local and international. The SBEP aims to equip top-brass corporate executives, high-ranking government officials, and entrepreneurs to craft innovative strategies and robust business models in the new environment strongly influenced by the so-called Industrial Revolution 4.0 (Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Robotization, and Artificial Intelligence). I have been reminding top executives in the Philippine business world that those who obtained their MBA or other advanced business-related degrees even just five years ago are already technologically obsolete today and must upskill themselves in digitalization, especially regarding Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics. In fact, to show that I "walk the talk," I accompanied some 30 participants in our current SBEP course to Barcelona during the first week of May 2025 to take a micro-credentials course on Artificial Intelligence at Europe’s top business school, the IESE Business School.\nThe SBEP enhances senior executives’ capabilities in coping with the latest global, regional, and local economic trends, the inevitable rise of digitalization and AI, and the primal importance of leadership and human capital, all within the context of rapidly evolving knowledge-based economies. The program accomplishes this by focusing on strategic thinking and governance, the discipline of economics as applied to business, best business practices, personal development, and an orientation to the common good (especially as advocated by the Social Doctrine of the Catholic Church). The SBEP's 50 years of successfully running this executive education program has involved training over 1,800 senior executives from 26 countries and hundreds of companies—not just top corporations, but also medium-sized, dynamic enterprises, professionals (e.g., lawyers, doctors, engineers, CPAs, architects), and government officials, including the police and military. The diversity and C-suite level of the participants contribute to a truly enriching exchange of theory, experience, wisdom, and networking, all highly appreciated by SBEP alumni.\nWith a hybrid program delivery, a convenient eleven-month class schedule, top-class and business-honed professors, and networking opportunities involving key government officials and business leaders, participants return to their respective organizations re-energized and equipped with strategies and innovative solutions leading them to success in the new global business economic landscape. For those participants who decide to write the equivalent of a masteral thesis (under the guidance of a professor and aided by UA&P-trained business economists), the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) has authorized UA&P to grant them the degree of Master in Business Economics. Those who choose not to write a thesis but have participated in a required minimum of sessions are granted a Certificate in Business Economics (CBE). For more information about the SBEP, you can contact (632) 8637-0912 to 26. To be continued.

of-airports-wi-fi-and-gida	Of airports, Wi-Fi, and GIDA	The Philippines’ competitive ranking among its regional peers still leaves much to be desired, clinging to the 13th slot out of 14 economies in the Asia-Pacific region.\nWhile we’ve seen some advancement in productivity and efficiency, including management practices, the Swiss-based International Institute of Management Development continues to point to our infrastructure pillar as the real challenge.\nYes, Virginia, it’s absolutely imperative for the government to get critical infrastructure projects in place. We’re talking about vast networks of highways, transportation, and utilities, especially in what we call “GIDA”—Geographically Isolated and Disadvantaged Areas. These are vital for improving service and connectivity.\nThis past Monday, at the Economic Journalists Association of the Philippines (EJAP) Infrastructure Forum, Department of Information and Communications Technology Undersecretary Henry Aguda and Transportation Secretary Vivencio “Vince” Dizon walked us through the government’s ambitious infrastructure plans.\nFrom where I was sitting, I was simply overwhelmed by the enormity of it all, particularly when it came to internet connectivity. Secretary Aguda explained their program for free Wi-Fi, with a sharp focus on GIDA, at a staggering cost of ₱9 billion.\nThis discussion immediately brings to mind the significance of passing the “Konektadong Pinoy” bill, even amidst the reservations and apprehensions already voiced by telecom giants, Globe and Smart. This priority bill aims to clear roadblocks by streamlining the licensing process, promoting infrastructure sharing, and allowing new, smaller players to invest in data transmission infrastructure without needing a full-blown legislative franchise.\nHowever, from what I've heard, there's concern that nothing in the proposed bill serves to focus on underserved areas and, notably, GIDA.\nFor me, free Wi-Fi is a delicate issue, primarily because of cybersecurity. Without a doubt, free Wi-Fi is an open invitation for delinquent individuals to take advantage of users by gaining unauthorized access to data on computers or handheld phones. And let’s be honest, even the enforcement of the SIM Card Registration Law of 2022 hasn’t quite hit its mark in ensuring accountability for SIM card users or fully helping law enforcers track down hacking and phishing perpetrators.\nI understand there’s no certainty in completely achieving the law’s purpose, as scammers and hackers have truly leveled up, becoming far more sophisticated, with their playground stretching out to include even more avenues.\nThe other side of this critical infrastructure program, and frankly, the one I find more pleasing and gratifying, is the privatization of operations for at least 10 more regional airports. This is designed to improve inter-island travel. A collateral benefit of allowing the private sector in through a public-private partnership program is the potential to attract many more foreign tourists. While we have so much to offer, the Philippines is still waiting to become the traveler’s top choice.\nForemost on this list is the Godofredo Ramos Airport, better known as Caticlan Airport, the very gateway to our internationally acclaimed Boracay Island. It’s currently owned and operated by Trans Aire Development Holdings Corp., a subsidiary of SMC Infrastructure. I must admit, the upgrade of Caticlan Airport, to be undertaken by Megawide, is particularly in my interest, as Boracay is truly an Ilonggo’s pride. Other touristy airports slated for privatization include Laguindingan and Bohol-Panglao.\nWhile we're on the topic, allow me a moment to salute the leadership of SMC President Ramon S. Ang. His diversified food and beverage conglomerate has, once again, been named the highest-ranking Philippine company in the 2025 Fortune Southeast Asia 500, securing the 9th spot on this prestigious list of the region’s largest companies by revenue.\nThis is the second time SMC has been recognized in regional business rankings, following last February’s release of TIME and Statista’s 2025 Top 500 Companies Shaping Business in the Asia-Pacific region.\nAs RSA himself puts it, this recognition is not only a “reflection of our financial performance but our commitment to nation-building and to supporting communities wherever we operate,” but, more importantly, an aspiration for SMC to “keep raising the bar.”\nSalud RSA and EJAP for another successful forum!\nTalkback to me at sionil731@gmail.com	"\\tImages/of-airports-wi-fi-and-gida_1.png"	The Philippines lags in regional infrastructure, particularly in geographically isolated areas (GIDA).  A ₱9 billion free Wi-Fi program targets GIDA, alongside concerns about cybersecurity.  Privatization of 10 regional airports aims to boost tourism and inter-island travel.

sra-mandates-registration-for-sugar-alternative-importers-to-combat-smuggling	SRA mandates registration for sugar alternative importers to combat smuggling	The Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) is calling on importers of sugar alternatives to register as international sugar traders, as part of the agency’s efforts to crack down on smuggled sugar products that deprive the government of tariff collections.\nUnder Memorandum Circular No. 6, the SRA said importers covered by Chapter 17 of the 2022 ASEAN Harmonized Tariff Nomenclature (AHTN) must register with the agency as international sugar traders (other sugars and sugar confectionery).\nThe AHTN is an eight-digit harmonized system commodity nomenclature within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which the Philippines then applies alpha-numeric codes to provide for its local tariff lines.\nThe SRA said the registration will allow importers to secure a clearance for the release of imported commodities for their sugar alternatives.\nImporters will have until Nov. 30 to register.\nSRA Administrator Pablo Luis Azcona stated that the primary purpose of the order is to collect accurate data on the so-called other sugars, which fall under tariff heading 1702.\n“We just want accurate data, we just also want the government to earn the proper tariffs,” he said in a television interview.\nLast week, the SRA and the Department of Agriculture (DA) inspected smuggled goods earlier flagged by the Bureau of Customs (BOC) at the Port of Manila.\nTwo of the four seized containers were found to have imported 88 percent refined sugar, instead of the declared initially sweetener mix. The sugar commodity falls under tariff heading 1701.\nAzcona said the misdeclaration, if not seized, would have cost the government about four percent in tariffs.\nAt the same time, the administrator stated that accurate data from the importers will be crucial for the government in planning future policies and measures regarding the country’s sugar supply.\nHe noted that this will strengthen regulatory measures on imported sugar alternatives, which have steadily risen in recent years, leading to a drop in demand for locally produced sugar.\nAzcona added that the government should be able to identify the importer, the product being imported, its destination, and the industry that will use the product.\n“This will make the planning side of the whole sugar industry easier,” he said.\nBeginning Dec. 1, all importers who are not registered with the SRA will not be granted a release clearance for their commodities.\nAzcona said the sugar agency can only release import clearances for importers who are certified as international sugar traders.	"\\tImages/sra-mandates-registration-for-sugar-alternative-importers-to-combat-smuggling_1.png"	The SRA mandates registration for sugar alternative importers to combat smuggling and ensure proper tariff collection.  Importers have until November 30th to register; otherwise, release clearances will be denied starting December 1st.  The move aims to gather accurate data on imported sugars and improve policy-making regarding the country's sugar supply.  Misdeclaration of imported goods costs the government significant revenue.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/03/sra-mandates-registration-for-sugar-alternative-importers-to-combat-smuggling

This ultimately ensures uninterrupted connectivity for homes, businesses, education, and emergency response.

philippines-swings-to-298-million-bop-deficit-in-may-as-govt-taps-dollar-reserves-for-debt-payments	Philippines swings to $298-million BOP deficit in May as gov't taps dollar reserves for debt payments	The Philippines’ balance of payments (BOP) swung to a $298-million deficit in May, a reversal from the billion-dollar surplus a year ago, as the government drew down its dollar reserves to pay foreign debts.\nData from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) showed that the country’s BOP, which reflects its international transactions, reversed the $2-billion surplus recorded in May last year.\nAccording to the BSP’s statement released on Friday, June 20, “the BOP deficit reflected the national government’s drawdowns on its foreign currency deposits with the BSP to service external debt obligations.”\nAs such, the $1.6-billion surplus recorded in the first five months of 2024 shifted to a $5.8-billion deficit in the January-to-May period this year.\n“Preliminary data indicate that the year-to-date BOP deficit was largely due to the continued trade in goods deficit,” the BSP reported.\nAccording to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), the trade deficit for the first four months of the year narrowed slightly to $15.9 billion, down from $16 billion a year earlier.\nHowever, the BSP noted this “decline was partly muted by the sustained net inflows from personal remittances from overseas Filipinos, foreign borrowings by the national government, and foreign portfolio investments (FPI).”\nAs per the central bank, the BOP trend followed a slight drop in the country’s gross international reserves (GIR) or United States (US) dollar stock, which slipped from $105.3 billion at the end of April to $105.2 billion by the end of May.\nStill, the GIR level “remains a strong external liquidity buffer, sufficient to cover 7.1 months' worth of imports of goods and payments of services and primary income,” the BSP said.\nThe latest GIR level ensures the country has enough foreign currency to cover its BOP needs, such as paying for imports or servicing debts, even in worst-case scenarios when export earnings or foreign loans dry up.\nIt also covers about 3.3 times the country’s short-term foreign debt based on residual maturity.\nShort-term debt based on residual maturity includes all foreign debt originally due in one year or less, along with upcoming principal payments on medium-term and long-term loans from both the public and private sectors that are set to mature within the next 12 months.

This deficit resulted from the government using dollar reserves for debt payments. The January-to-May period saw a $5.8 billion deficit, primarily due to a trade deficit.  Despite this, the country's gross international reserves remain sufficient to cover import and debt obligations.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/20/philippines-swings-to-298-million-bop-deficit-in-may-as-govt-taps-dollar-reserves-for-debt-payments
robust-demand-drives-down-rates-for-governments-30-billion-bond-sale	Robust demand drives down rates for government's ₱30-billion bond sale	The Marcos administration has borrowed its planned ₱30 billion from local lenders through the sale of long-term debt securities at lower interest rates, due to strong demand and expectations of further inflation slowdown. The Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) awarded the offered amount through the sale of five-year Treasury bonds (T-bonds). Bids totaled ₱59.9 billion, nearly twice the amount offered. Demand was slightly higher than the ₱55.2 billion in tenders from the same auction on April 29. The sale saw a slight decline in interest rates but a relatively stronger interest from domestic creditors. With a remaining maturity of five years and one month, the bonds were awarded at an average rate of 5.887 percent. This was 5.6 basis points (bp) lower than the previous auction’s 5.943 percent. This was 1.1 bps higher than the 5.898-percent rate for comparable corporate bonds in the secondary market, based on the PHP Bloomberg Valuation (BVAL) Service Reference Rate. Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. (RCBC) Chief Economist Michael L. Ricafort said that the softer yield, relative to the reference and previous rates, comes ahead of the June 5 inflation report, which is expected to show continued easing. The decline also follows a recent pullback in US Treasury yields, with the 10-year benchmark falling to a two-week low of 4.43 percent. Other positive factors include the central bank’s recent signal of two quarter-point rate cuts for the remainder of 2025. The outlook is supported by easing inflation and a stable economic backdrop. He noted that the peso’s sustained strength against the US dollar, alongside over three-year low global crude oil prices, and easing import costs and inflation pressures, could prompt further monetary easing in the months ahead. The Philippines borrows more locally, through treasury bills and bonds, than from foreign sources. This borrowing strategy leverages domestic banks and creditors who are flush with cash, while mitigating exposure to foreign exchange (forex) risks and volatility. The government’s outstanding debt was equivalent to 62 percent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter, its highest level in two years. It climbed from 60.7 percent at the end of 2024. Specifically, domestic debt stood at 42.3 percent of GDP, while foreign debt had a GDP ratio of 19.7 percent.	"\\tImages/robust-demand-drives-down-rates-for-governments-30-billion-bond-sale_1.png"	The Philippine government successfully raised ₱30 billion through a bond sale, exceeding its target with bids totaling ₱59.9 billion.  Strong demand led to lower interest rates at 5.887 percent, down from the previous auction.  This is attributed to easing inflation, a pullback in US Treasury yields, and the central bank signaling rate cuts.  The government's borrowing strategy prioritizes domestic sources to mitigate forex risks.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/03/robust-demand-drives-down-rates-for-governments-30-billion-bond-sale
strengthening-disaster-preparedness-sm-makes-the-incident-command-system-possible	Strengthening disaster preparedness: SM makes the Incident Command System possible	In a country like the Philippines, where typhoons, earthquakes, and other natural calamities are part of the norm, resilience is not just a necessity but a way of life. Ranked consistently high in the World Risk Index due to its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire and the typhoon belt, the nation faces challenges that demand coordinated, forward-thinking approaches to disaster preparedness and response.\nAmong those leading the way is SM Supermalls, whose commitment to resilience continues to evolve through investments in systems that safeguard not only business continuity but, more importantly, the communities they serve.\nDisaster resilience in the private sector has become increasingly crucial. Corporations have the capacity to create ripple effects both in terms of operational continuity and their influence on surrounding communities. For SM, a sustained and risk-informed approach to resilience ensures that when emergencies strike, response is swift, coordinated, and grounded in tested protocols.\nA key initiative in this approach is the company’s very own rollout of the Incident Command System (ICS). Designed to provide a standardized structure for managing emergency response, the ICS originated in the United States and is widely recognized as an on-scene, all-hazard incident management concept. Through its unified hierarchy and clearly defined roles, the ICS ensures that different responders---from government agencies to private security teams---can act in sync. This leads to more efficient resource management, better communication, and a higher degree of accountability during high-pressure situations.\nAs part of the initiative, SM regularly implements emergency preparedness drills across its network of malls and consistently participates in nationwide efforts for disaster preparedness, such as the annual fire and earthquake drills led by the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP). These efforts are complemented by support for the quarterly Nationwide Simultaneous Earthquake Drills led by the Office of Civil Defense (OCD) and the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC). These exercises include both employees and tenants, creating a culture of readiness that extends beyond corporate boundaries.\nIn addition, 79 SM Supermalls have been certified under the Business Continuity Management Systems---a reflection of the company’s structured and systematized approach to disaster risk reduction and recovery. This level of certification not only reflects internal diligence but also sets a benchmark for the broader business sector.\nSM also has a dedicated resilience center, which operates as a centralized communications hub during large-scale disruptions. This facility coordinates with all SM malls to ensure rapid information flow and streamlined decision-making in the event of a national emergency.\nSM’s collaborative approach to disaster resilience was also demonstrated during the 2024 Asia- Pacific Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Manila. On the last day of the conference, SM City Clark became the focal point of an ICS demonstration attended by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Resilience and foreign delegates.\nThe event showcased a unified response involving mall management, the Clark and Angeles municipalities, the BFP, OCD Region 3, and NDRRMC. Together, they enacted coordinated procedures designed to enhance public safety, offering an up-close look at how integrated disaster response works in a real-world environment.\nIn preparation for the site visit, SM Supermalls partnered with ARISE Philippines, the Private Sector Alliance for Resilient Societies, to conduct an ICS workshop alongside the OCD. This training brought together heads of operations, human resources, security, and Information Technology from SM City Clark and nearby locators such as Park Inn Hotel. Facilitated by experts from the BFP and the Philippine Army, the workshop provided hands-on training in ICS protocol, further reinforcing the company’s commitment to capacity-building at the local level.\nSM’s vision for resilience is expansive and continuous. Following the success of the Clark initiative, the company is now preparing to roll out the next phase of ICS workshops, beginning with SM Mall of Asia and expanding to regional malls across the country. This nationwide implementation reflects a long-term strategy that prioritizes safety, community cohesion, and operational readiness.\n“By investing in frameworks like the ICS, SM Supermalls demonstrates that resilience is not a reactive measure but an ongoing commitment,” said SM Supermalls Vice President Engr. Liza Silerio. “In a landscape defined by environmental vulnerability, this commitment provides not only peace of mind but a tangible sense of preparedness for employees, tenants, and the public at large.”\nThrough proactive strategies and sustained partnerships with government and civil society, SM is building more than safe spaces. It is also cultivating a culture of resilience that empowers people and protects communities in the face of any uncertainty, reiterating its commitment to promoting a more disaster-ready Philippines.

The company conducts regular drills and participates in nationwide disaster preparedness efforts.  79 SM Supermalls are certified under Business Continuity Management Systems.  SM's proactive approach builds a culture of resilience, protecting communities and promoting a disaster-ready Philippines.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/03/strengthening-disaster-preparedness-sm-makes-the-incident-command-system-possible
moodys-flags-double-edged-conglomerate-ties-for-philippine-banks	Moody's flags 'double-edged' conglomerate ties for Philippine banks	While closer ties to large conglomerates provide Philippine banks with ample capital and lending opportunities, these direct connections also increase lending risks within the groups, and financial distress at the conglomerate level could have a profound impact on the banks.\n\n“Financial distress in a conglomerate could have a cascading effect on its subsidiaries, including the banks they own; this would amplify shocks and lead to broader financial instability,” the debt watcher Moody’s Ratings said in a report about the double-edged effect of Philippine banks’ ties with conglomerates.\n\nThis report, published on Wednesday, June 19, revealed the interlinking of Philippine conglomerates with their subsidiaries, including banks. It featured several parent groups, such as Ayala Corporation (linked to the Ayala family), JG Summit Holdings (Gokongwei family), House of Investments (Yuchengco family), GT Capital (Ty family), SM Investments (Sy family), Aboitiz Equity Ventures (Aboitiz family), and LT Group (Lucio Tan).\n\nRated banks directly or indirectly owned by these conglomerates include the Bank of the Philippines Islands (BPI), Rizal Commercial Banking Corp (RCBC), Banco de Oro (BDO), China Banking Corporation (Chinabank), Philippine National Bank (PNB), Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company (Metrobank), and Union Bank of the Philippines (UnionBank).\n\nMoody’s argued that if a conglomerate grapples with a crisis, its bank could take the hardest hit as it might be forced to provide support by lending more money to save the parent company. This could hurt the bank’s financial strength and stability, Moody's noted.\n\n“Any challenge to NFCs’ [non-financial corporations] financial health and debt repayment abilities would have a material credit impact on Philippine banks’ asset quality, solvency, and liquidity,” it said.\n\nThe credit rater argued that these “interlinkages exacerbate risks from related-party lending” or lending within big business groups.\n\nOn average, loans within the business groups in the Philippines account for 20 percent of a bank’s core capital—the “highest” in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), said Moody’s.\n\nBank loans to NFCs account for about 77 percent of the total bank lending in the country, as they prefer borrowing from local banks over issuing bonds because the local bond market remains small.\n\nRelative to ASEAN countries, lending to big businesses accounts for a “larger share” in the financial system.\n\n“NFCs’ heavy reliance on banks for funding means that defaults would disproportionately impact banks, rather than other creditors,” Moody’s said.\n\nMeanwhile, the report noted that “the large conglomerate parents of rated banks maintain healthy corporate leverage, despite some weakening. Currently, banks’ related-party loans are largely to the operating NFCs within their conglomerate groups, with which banks have second-degree relationships.\n\nMoody’s views this a “relatively more favorable from a credit perspective as these are cash flow-generating, and the banks have relatively lower loan exposures to their parent holding companies.” In this sense, bank lending to their parent companies is much riskier.\n\nHowever, “a payment default could trigger a cross-default on the group's other obligations, or those of other group companies.” In this case, the parent company might have to cover those debts.\n\nLending to third-degree firms is “often opaque” and harder to track, which raises the likelihood of undetected risks.	"\\tImages/moodys-flags-double-edged-conglomerate-ties-for-philippine-banks_1.png,Images/moodys-flags-double-edged-conglomerate-ties-for-philippine-banks_2.png"	Philippine banks' close ties with large conglomerates offer ample capital and lending opportunities, but also heighten lending risks.  Financial distress in a conglomerate could severely impact connected banks, potentially causing broader instability.  Loans within business groups in the Philippines account for 20% of a bank's core capital, the highest in ASEAN.  Moody's highlights the double-edged nature of these relationships, warning of potential cascading effects.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/20/moodys-flags-double-edged-conglomerate-ties-for-philippine-banks
villar-land-eyes-further-capital-appreciation-in-villar-city-after-trillion-peso-gain	Villar Land eyes further capital appreciation in Villar City after trillion-peso gain	After booking a ₱1.33 trillion gain in property value in its Villar City, Villar Land Holdings Corporation sees more room for capital appreciation since it is still cheaper than comparable estates, while prices will rise with upcoming infrastructure and commercial developments.\n“The rising prominence of Villar City is aptly reflected in its commercial lot pricing, a reliable barometer of land values,” the company said in a statement.\nIt noted that, at present, Villar City’s commercial lots remain competitive compared to those in the more established nearby districts.\nFor instance, commercial lot prices within Villar City’s Innovation District start at ₱345,000 per square meter, which is lower than Filinvest City’s prices, which range from ₱396,000 per square meter to ₱592,000 per square meter.\nCommercial lot prices in Ayala Land’s Cerca Alabang, meanwhile, stood at ₱420,000 per sqm. “These comparable rates validate Villar Land’s fair-value revisions, mirroring actual transaction values in the market,” it added.\n“It should be noted that Villar City is still an emerging nexus for economic, lifestyle, cultural, and leisure activities.\n“This leaves room for capital appreciation given the ongoing and upcoming developments that will enhance connectivity, introduce new commercial hubs and lifestyle centers, and attract institutional-grade tenants—transforming underutilized plots into vibrant mixed-use districts and unlocking further upside for early investors,” the company said.\nIt cited infrastructure enhancements—such as Villar Avenue, which serves as the main thoroughfare connecting all districts in Villar City, the Muntinlupa-Cavite Expressway (MCX), and other future developments, including an integrated LRT system and Bus Rapid Transit network—are all poised to improve connectivity and convenience.\nVillar Land has also announced, launched, and opened landmark developments since this megalopolis’ official launch in 2023, including the 118-ha mixed-use estate called Forresta and the Forresta Cafe, upcoming developments, such as the Villar City Stadium, two 18-hole championship golf courses designed in partnership with Curley-Wagner Golf Design, and strategic collaborations like the University of the Philippines-Dasmariñas campus.\nThrough decades of strategic acquisitions, publicly listed Villar Land has built a formidable landbank, its crown jewel being Villar City, a 3,500-hectare estate that straddles southern Metro Manila and Cavite.\nMajor infrastructure projects—from the Laguna Expressway and C-5 South Link to the planned LRT and commuter-rail extensions—have turned these once peripheral tracts into tomorrow’s commuter corridors.\nConnectivity gains have since fueled brisk pre-selling of residential communities in Villar City, spurred commercial leasing inquiries, and ignited early demand for mixed-use developments.\nBy securing these strategic sites decades ago, Villar Land now enjoys an edge in a growth corridor that has begun benefiting from rising land values, dwindling developable land in the metro, and a steady influx of residents and businesses.	"\\tImages/villar-land-eyes-further-capital-appreciation-in-villar-city-after-trillion-peso-gain_1.png"	Villar Land Holdings Corporation reported a ₱1.33 trillion gain in Villar City's property value and anticipates further appreciation.  Commercial lots in Villar City are competitively priced compared to nearby established districts, leaving room for capital appreciation.  Upcoming infrastructure and developments will enhance connectivity and attract more businesses and residents.  This growth is fueled by strategic land acquisitions and major infrastructure projects.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/03/villar-land-eyes-further-capital-appreciation-in-villar-city-after-trillion-peso-gain

Ang stated that the firm’s performance will improve further due to additional revenues generated from SMC’s operations at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport.\nHe added that, the 66 kilometer tollway from Sto. Tomas, Batangas to Lucena, Quezon, will also be completed by next year and will provide a new source of revenue.\nAng said, “We are also preparing to build South Luzon expressway toll road number five, which is a 420 kilometer tollway that will stretch from Lucena, Quezon, all the way to Matnog, Sorsogon.”\n“We are also starting a lot of new businesses while our existing businesses are very stable,” said Ang.\nHe noted that the company’s primary focus now is to finish the massive $15 billion Bulacan airport project which will be a game changer as it will allow the Philippines to generate more revenues from tourism and reduce its dependence of overseas workers and the business process outsourcing industry.\nMeanwhile, Ang said SMC continues to expand its existing tollways to add more capacity while its power generation business is adding new renewable energy sources such as solar and hydropower.\n“Most of our 1,000 megawatt battery storage is now energized, helping stabilize the grid while supporting the integration of renewables, solar, and wind.\n“We will build several hydro facilities, including a 2,000 megawatt pump hydro project in San Roque, Pangasinan, to provide clean and reliable energy. We are also expanding our solar project to deliver clean power that helps meet demand across many industries,” he said.\nHe also noted that Petron Corporation is doing well “despite the turbulence in international crude prices” because management has been adept at hedging supply to lock in favorable prices.\n“Petron is investing in more service stations and fuel depots, while improving logistics for greater efficiency,” Ang added.

Aquino.\nThe Commission on June 2 received confirmation that the COA rendered an “unmodified opinion,” also known as an “unqualified opinion,” on the fairness of the presentation of the Commission’s 2024 financial statements.\nAn unmodified opinion is given when auditors conclude that the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatements, which could arise from either error or fraud, according to the International Public Sector Accounting Standards.\n“As corporate registrar and capital market regulator, it is only fitting that the SEC uphold the highest standards of transparency and accountability in the management of public funds,” said Aquino, who is the first certified public accountant and lawyer to serve as SEC chairperson.\nHe added that, “This affirms our steadfast commitment to transparency, accountability, and sound fiscal management in serving the public trust. We hope that by leading by example, the corporate sector is able to follow suit in exercising sound fund management in their overall operations.”\nThe SEC also received an unqualified opinion on the fairness of presentation of its financial statements for the years starting 2018 to 2023. This stands as the longest streak of unqualified opinions the Commission has received over the past decade.\nThe SEC has continuously advocated for good governance and transparency in handling funds to build and maintain public trust in the institution.\nFollowing the nomination of COA, the SEC was named an Outstanding Accounting Office by the Association of Government Accountants of the Philippines twice in 2021 and 2023.\nAquino was likewise given the Accountancy Centenary Award of Excellence during the accountancy profession’s 100-year anniversary this year.\nIn May, the SEC received the 3G Leadership Award for Advocacy and Commitment to Corporate Governance from London-based Cambridge International Finance Advisory.

rising-expectations-two-consecutive-bsp-interest-rate-cuts-in-june-and-august	Rising expectations: Two consecutive BSP interest rate cuts in June and August	Expectations are growing among foreign banks for the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) to reduce key interest rates consecutively when its Monetary Board (MB) decides on the policy stance in June and August, with global investment banking giant Goldman Sachs joining the chorus.\n"We continue to expect the BSP to cut two more times (25 basis points [bps] each) in the second quarter and third quarter of this year, bringing the policy rate to five percent in the third quarter of 2025," from 5.5 percent at present, Goldman Sachs Economics Research said in a June 5 report obtained by Manila Bulletin.\nThis projection is mainly due to low inflation, as the headline rate fell to a nearly six-year low of 1.3 percent in May.\nThe MB, the policy-making arm of the BSP, is set to review its monetary policy stance on June 19. Following the expected rate cut of at least 25 bps next week, the next policy meeting is scheduled for Aug. 28—the sole meeting in the third quarter.\nThe final two monetary policy meetings for 2025 will take place in the fourth quarter, on Oct. 9 and Dec. 11.\nAs Manila Bulletin reported earlier, Singapore-based DBS Bank Ltd. also expects the BSP to lower the key borrowing cost by 50 bps to reach the "terminal" level of five percent in the third quarter of this year.\nEarlier on, Deutsche Bank Research economist Junjie Huang forecast 25 bps each of interest rate cuts at the MB's June and August policy meetings, citing BSP Governor Eli M. Remolona Jr.'s recent pronouncements of "maybe two more cuts" before the year ends.\nIn the case of also Singapore-based United Overseas Bank (UOB), it likewise expects the BSP to slash interest rates by 25 bps each in the second and third quarters, plus another 25-bp cut in the fourth quarter, to bring the policy rate down to 4.75 percent by year-end.

(SMPC) has secured an amended Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), paving the way for the expansion of its Semirara Coal Mine Complex.\nIn a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange on Wednesday, June 11, the Philippines' largest coal producer said the approval will ensure the continuation and increase of the company's coal production.\nThe amended ECC increased the project area to 5,221.75 hectares, within the existing 13,000-hectare Coal Operating Contract (COC) No. 5, originally granted by the Department of Energy (DOE).\nThe amendment allows SMPC to extend its operations beyond the COC's initial 2027 expiration. This includes continued mining at both the Acacia and Narra mines.\nFurthermore, the updated ECC boosts SMPC's annual coal production limit from 16 million to 20 million metric tons (MMT) through open-pit mining methods, effective from 2025 to 2027.\nWhile SMPC had previously targeted 2026 for production to begin at the Acacia pit, exploration and pre-stripping works are already underway. The company currently owns and operates its own fuel sources, solidifying its position as a key player in the country's energy sector.

Under its power supply agreement (PSA) with Meralco, the first phase will deliver 600 MWac, followed by the second phase, which will include 250 MWac of mid-merit renewable energy.\nPrevious reports by Manila Bulletin noted that the total project funding is anticipated to be the world's largest solar and battery facility in Central Luzon.\n“This project is set to commence commercial operations in the first quarter of 2026 for Phase 1,” BDO said.\nTo date, the project has reached 35 percent overall progress, marked by the ongoing construction of the substation, continued site development, and the start of assembling structures for the solar panels.\nThis landmark project, designed to help meet the country’s rising power demand, is expected to supply clean energy to around 2.4 million households.\nOnce completed, MTerra Solar is projected to reduce carbon emissions by approximately 4.3 million tons annually, equivalent to removing at least three million gasoline-powered cars from the road.\nSpanning over 3,500 hectares in Nueva Ecija and Bulacan, the project will also involve constructing a 13-kilometer, 500-kilovolt transmission line to connect the solar facility to the national grid.\n“As the world’s largest solar project and a first in the Philippines, it was essential to partner with\nthe country’s largest bank, BDO,” said Emmanuel V. Rubio, president and CEO of Meralco PowerGen Corporation (MGEN).\nMTerra Solar said it has the capacity to run the project but needs strong financial support from the country’s top banks to fund the development of this scale. Citing BDO Capital’s expertise in project finance, capital markets, and advisory services, the company tapped the bank to lead the loan arrangement due to the project’s complexity.\nDennis B. Jordan, president and CEO of MTerra Solar and MGEN Renewable Energy Inc., expressed his gratitude to all the project’s banking partners.\nHe stressed that the “trust and support” these lenders extended to the company “sends a strong message that local financing can drive world-scale renewable energy projects.”	"\\tImages/terra-solars-200-billion-solar-project-on-track-for-q1-2026-launchbdo_1.png"	Terra Solar's ₱200-billion solar and battery facility is slated to begin operations in Q1 2026.

the-unlikely-story-of-mcdonalds-philippines-founder-george-yang	The unlikely story of McDonald's Philippines founder George Yang	The story of George T. Yang, the visionary who brought McDonald's to the Philippines, is a tale of an underdog defying the odds. In the cutthroat world of international franchising, success often seems reserved for those with immense wealth and established power.\nIn the 1970s, Yang, a freshly minted Wharton Business School graduate, found himself competing for the coveted McDonald's franchise rights against some of the Philippines' most formidable business magnates.\n"I'm the most nobody among all the applicants," Yang candidly admitted in an interview with the Manila Bulletin.\nHe recounted having to borrow a relative's old Mercedes-Benz just to chauffeur the McDonald's representatives, who were in Manila to interview potential franchisees. His well-heeled competitors, meanwhile, were rolling out limousines.\nBut then, their drive took an unexpected turn. "It was in the middle of summer, they were all in coats and ties, three big guys in the back," Yang recalled. "When all of a sudden, the aircon went off in Ortigas. They all sweated." A wave of panic washed over him. "Patay na ito [we're doomed]," Yang thought.\nIt was an uphill battle. He revealed that applicants ranged from people who controlled a large brewery to titans in real estate and retail.\n"When they were trying to convince [McDonald's], they'd say, 'Our company is big…our companies are doing this and that..we’re a big corporation..we have the assets and the capital etc." I did not have that," he recounted.\nPersonal touch: George's secret weapon\nDespite the imposing display of wealth from his competitors, Yang held onto an inner conviction. "Somehow, I was confident," he recalled, sensing an edge over his rivals.\nThe 1970s: George T. Yang, a Wharton grad, stood against titans for the American fast-food giant.\nThe critical moment arrived when the president of McDonald's International touched down in Manila, prepared to personally interview the select few who had made the shortlist.\n"The president came to talk to us. He came with his wife, and I introduced them to my wife and my father. They came to my house to have a chat so they would know what kind of person we are." It was a personal touch, a window into the Yang family's character. This personal connection, rather than just financial might, became his secret weapon.\n“I told them, if you select me, I'll be in the store, running it myself. I won’t hire someone else to do it,” he stated. Yang, against all odds, secured the coveted McDonald's franchise, forming the Golden Arches Development Corporation (GADC) in partnership with McDonald's Corporation.\nWith the franchise in hand, Yang’s next task was securing the funding to build the actual stores, a commitment he made to the American executives to open 10 branches in the Philippines.\nThe initial capital required was substantial for the time, roughly ₱6 to ₱7 million per store. However, he found himself hitting a wall with local banks.\n"We spoke to a couple of local banks; they were interested but asked too many questions," Yang revealed.\nManila's first McDonald's\nThe breakthrough came when they approached an international bank. "It turns out, this international bank has been funding many of McDonald's franchisees all over the world, and then they never got really delinquent." \nThat established track record with other McDonald’s franchisees proved to be Yang's golden ticket. The global bank partner provided the much-needed loan without requiring collateral, enabling him to open the very first McDonald's branch in Morayta (now Nicanor Reyes Street) in Manila in 1981. \nThe very first McDonald's in the Philippines opened its doors on Morayta St. (now Nicanor Reyes St.) in Manila in 1981.\nBut before becoming the first store manager of the Morayta branch, Yang secretly—without the US head office's permission—trained as a crew member at a McDonald's in Hong Kong. He even brought his son, Kenneth, along on one occasion to observe.\n"I worked in Hong Kong, I worked as a crew," Yang revealed. "They didn't know that I was somebody waiting to become an owner-operator. So they thought of me as a crew. They treated me as one, and it was very tough," he admitted.\nThis experience, however, shaped his philosophy on employee welfare, especially for the crew members in McDonald's stores.\n"The restaurant crew, for me, are the most important," Yang stated. "The people who work in the restaurants. We even call our office employees ‘support center’ because our decisions are made to support our crew and managers in the stores. That's just how it is." \nMore than just a business, McDonald's Philippines was built on George T. Yang's belief that "the people who work in the restaurants" are everything.\nLocal flavors, a lasting legacy\nAfter a successful initial launch, McDonald's was warmly embraced by Filipino consumers, quickly leading to the opening of a second branch in Cubao, Quezon City. Yet, not everything was smooth sailing. Yang soon noticed that certain menu items weren't performing as well as anticipated.\nHe sought to introduce flexibility in McDonald's menu to suit Filipino tastes better, but it took some time to convince his partners otherwise. After many pitches, McDonald’s Corporation agreed and allowed Yang to introduce items beyond the standard menu, such as fried chicken, rice, and spaghetti. \nYang said this decision to adapt to local tastes wasn't just a win for him, as it evolved into a global practice that has since benefited different local markets to offer products unique or relevant to their customers. It helped a lot of other franchisees worldwide.\n"Now our local products, the ones we created, are our best sellers," Yang proudly stated. "You know, without our bone-in fried chicken, Chicken McDo, it would be harder to compete. In the early years, we didn’t have that." \nFrom Yang's initial commitment to open 10 branches in the country, McDonald's Philippines expanded to 792 stores by the end of 2024 and is expected to open its 800th location this year.\nDespite this remarkable expansion, Yang himself believes the growth could have been even more rapid if McDonald’s Philippines had more operational flexibility from the outset. \nIn 2005, Chicago-based McDonald's Corporation sold its minority stake in the Philippines to Yang and his investment partner, Andrew Tan.\nToday, the legacy continues as George Yang’s son, Kenneth, leads McDonald's Philippines’ daily operations as president and chief executive officer of GADC.\n“McDonald’s Philippines is 100 percent Filipino,” Yang declared.\nUnbreakable partnership\nIn April, McDonald's Corporation solidified its long-standing partnership with the Yang family, signing a new 20-year franchise agreement that ensures GADC will continue operating McDonald's in the Philippines until 2045.\n"I was confident that they would renew us because of how we have grown and cared for the McDonald’s brand in the Philippines," Yang stated candidly. "We've contributed significantly in expanding McDonald’s footprint while contributing to nation-building." \nAmong the partners in the region (Asia Pacific) who around the same time first opened McDonald’s stores in Brazil, Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia—the Yang family is now the sole “original” partner remaining in the system, as others eventually divested or sold back their stake to McDonald’s Corporation.\nYang also shared a unique detail about their new franchise agreement: it's personally named under him and his son, Kenneth.\nGeorge T. Yang and son Kenneth, the last "original" McDonald's partners in Asia Pacific, sign a new 20-year franchise agreement in April 2025, extending the Yang family's legacy until 2045.\n”The franchise is granted to George Yang and Kenneth Yang," he revealed. "Normally, it's given to the operating company, which is Golden Arches. But while Golden Arches manages the day-to-day, Kenneth and I remain the master franchise holders of McDonald’s; we are the owners of the business name." \nWhen asked about this unusual arrangement, Yang simply replied, "Because they trust me and they trust Kenneth." \nHe further clarified, "We might have partners, but they don't own the franchise. We personally hold the franchise." \nYang described this arrangement as win-win. "McDonald's continues to grow in the country, with us managing and assuming the risks of running the business—a testament to McDonald's Corporation's trust in us," he explained. \n"And for us, it’s also incredibly important that we have ownership, or the franchise license in our name to ensure that we continue to bring to life our purpose: serve Filipino customers with great tasting, quality, value-for-money food, and make a positive difference in the lives of more Filipinos through employment generation and community development, for more decades to come," he concluded.

His secret weapon was a personal touch, showcasing his family and commitment to running the stores himself.  He adapted the menu to suit Filipino tastes, introducing local favorites that became bestsellers, and built the business on a philosophy of valuing restaurant crews.  Today, the Yang family's legacy continues with a renewed 20-year franchise agreement.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/14/the-unlikely-story-of-mcdonalds-philippines-founder-george-yang
weaker-growth-peso-seen-ahead-as-imports-surge-doubles-current-account-deficit-to-42-billion-in-q1	Weaker growth, peso seen ahead as imports surge doubles Q1 current account deficit to $4.2 billion	A wider current account deficit drove the Philippines’ balance of payments (BOP) position from a $238-million surplus in the first quarter of 2024 to a $3-billion deficit in the same period this year, according to the central bank.\nFor the January-to-March period, the country’s current account deficit doubled to $4.2 billion in 2025 from $2.1 billion a year earlier, the latest Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) data showed.\n“This development reflected the widening merchandise trade gap, as import spending grew faster than export earnings,” the BSP said in a statement released on Friday, June 13. The current account—or net dollar earnings—component in the country’s BOP covers goods, services, as well as income from Filipinos working abroad, and other sources.\nThe Philippines is a net importer of the goods it consumes. Economists expect a surge of products coming from China—already the top source of Philippine imports for many years now—as Chinese exporters look for alternative markets other than the United States (US) amid renewed trade tensions between Beijing and Washington.\nThe central bank added that the bigger first-quarter current account deficit was also driven by lower earnings from services—which includes business process outsourcing (BPO)—as transport receipts declined while outbound travel expenses of Filipino tourists bloated.\nThis wider deficit translates into an increased share in the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). It climbed to 3.7 percent in the first quarter of 2025, from 1.9 percent in the same quarter a year ago.\nHigher remittances from overseas Filipinos (OFs) had slightly offset further expansion of the deficit in net dollar earnings, according to the BSP.\nThe BSP had projected the current account deficit would further widen to $19.8 billion, or 3.9 percent of GDP, this year.\nLast year, the deficit stood at $17.5 billion, or 3.8 percent of GDP—larger than the $12.4 billion, or 2.8 percent of GDP, in 2023.\nThe government had partly blamed the dismal 5.4-percent year-on-year GDP growth in the first quarter to the “very sharp increase in the trade deficit.”\nAlso, a wider current account deficit puts depreciation pressures on the Philippine peso.\nBack in April, the World Bank said that the peso’s gains against the US dollar at the start of this year may be erased by the widening current account deficit amid declining net exports.\nThe peso averaged ₱57.97 against the US dollar in the first quarter, slightly stronger than the ₱58.15 recorded in the previous quarter.\nBut the local currency saw a 3.5-percent decline from ₱55.96 in the same period last year.\nStill, the peso “gained external price competitiveness against the baskets of currencies of major trading partners and trading partners in advanced and developing countries on a year-on year basis as indicated by the decreases in real effective exchange rate (REER) indices,” the BSP said.\nMeanwhile, the BOP’s capital account posted a $23-million surplus in the first quarter, rising 35.9 percent from $17 million a year earlier. This was due to $4 million in disposals of non-produced non-financial assets, versus $1 million in acquisitions in the same period last year.\nNon-produced non-financial assets cover intellectual property (IP), including trademarks and copyrights.\nThe financial account generated $6.7 billion in net inflows, increasing by 43.2 percent from $4.6 billion a year ago. This was attributed to higher direct and other investment inflows, plus steady portfolio investments.\nDuring the quarter, the country’s gross international reserves (GIR) or US dollar stock, reached $106.7 billion, higher by 2.5 percent than the $104.1 billion last year. GIR are foreign assets held by the BSP, mainly composed of foreign-issued securities, gold, and foreign exchange (forex).

This wider deficit, now 3.7% of GDP, puts depreciation pressure on the Philippine peso. Higher remittances from overseas Filipinos partially offset the deficit expansion. The government partly blamed the increased trade deficit for the weak 5.4% GDP growth.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/14/weaker-growth-peso-seen-ahead-as-imports-surge-doubles-current-account-deficit-to-42-billion-in-q1
tobacco-farmers-set-for-bigger-payday-as-prices-soar-nta-says	Tobacco farmers set for bigger payday as prices soar, NTA says	The National Tobacco Administration (NTA) stated that tobacco trading remains in full operation in the country, despite the onset of the rainy season, with farmers expected to earn more due to the high prices of the commodity.\nIn a statement on Saturday, June 14, the NTA said trading centers for flue-cured Virginia tobacco in the Ilocos region are open until June 30.\nThe establishments that are open in the region are under Universal Leaf Philippines Inc. (ULPI), Trans Manila Inc. (TMI), and Continental Leaf Tobacco Philippines Inc. (Conleaf).\nNTA-La Union Department Manager Giovanni Palabay said Virginia tobacco produced by farmers beyond the stated deadline will still be accepted once requested for accommodation by the agency.\nPalabay said the highest buying price offered by the trading centers to the farmers could reach up to ₱130 per kilo, depending on the quality of the flue-cured Virginia tobacco leaves.\nMeanwhile, trading operations for burley and native tobacco in the Ilocos Region, Cagayan Valley, Central Luzon, and Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) will end on Aug. 31.\nNTA said the highest buying price for burley tobacco per kilo is ₱118, while the native Batek tobacco is ₱175 per kilo.\nAside from ULPI, companies that are buying burley and native tobacco include Pentaleaf in Cagayan Valley, as well as Antonio and Josefina Trading Center (A&J TC) and John Medriano Trading Center (JMTC) in La Union.\nThe tobacco agency said farmers in Mindanao sell their native Batek tobacco at the “Tabo Market.”\nBased on the latest NTA data, there are a total of 59,242 registered tobacco farmers in the country, covering 32,503 hectares of tobacco.\nIt is estimated that about 2.2 million Filipinos are financially dependent on the crop.\nNTA Administrator Belinda Sanchez said tobacco farmers would earn more this cropping season due to high buying prices.\nThe reported buying prices of tobacco at the trading centers are higher than the tobacco floor prices, she said.\nAccording to the NTA, the following are the latest approved tobacco floor prices of classes of all tobacco types this season:\nFlue-cured Virginia tobacco: Class AA – ₱97; A – ₱96; B – ₱95; C – ₱93; D – ₱85; E – ₱84; F1 – ₱75; F2 – ₱72; and R – ₱61.\nBurley tobacco: Class A – ₱81; B – ₱78; C – ₱69; D – ₱58; E – ₱57; F – ₱49; and R – ₱39.\nNative tobacco: High Grade – ₱81; Medium 1 – ₱70; Medium2 – ₱60; Low 1 –₱50; and Low 2 – ₱38.\nTobacco is the only cash crop in the country that has approved floor prices, which are adjusted every two years through a tripartite forum among farmers, traders, and tobacco manufacturers.\nThe NTA is mandated by law to authorize the setting of tobacco floor prices by adopting the said forum.	"\\tImages/tobacco-farmers-set-for-bigger-payday-as-prices-soar-nta-says_1.png"	Tobacco farmers in the Philippines are expecting higher earnings due to increased tobacco prices.  Trading centers are open until June 30th for flue-cured Virginia tobacco and August 31st for burley and native tobacco.  Prices are as high as ₱130 per kilo for Virginia tobacco, ₱118 for burley, and ₱175 for native Batek tobacco.  About 2.2 million Filipinos depend on the tobacco crop financially.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/16/tobacco-farmers-set-for-bigger-payday-as-prices-soar-nta-says
stock-transaction-tax-cut-could-supercharge-pse-trading-by-83	Stock transaction tax cut could supercharge PSE trading by 83%	The implementation of the reduced stock transaction tax next month could theoretically result in an 83 percent surge in value turnover in the Philippine Stock Exchange, although even a fraction of this growth will already be a big boost to the local bourse.\nAbacus Securities Corporation noted that when this tax was increased by 20 percent from 0.5 percent to 0.6 percent, starting Jan. 1, 2018, the market's average daily turnover declined by about 11 percent that year.\n“With the sharper magnitude in this year's reduction, in theory and assuming the same level of impact but in the opposite direction, value turnover could increase by up to 83 percent,” it added.\nHowever, Abacus pointed out that, “In reality, the positive impact on value turnover will probably be much smaller.\n“However, given that this has not really yet recovered the drop since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war and the rise of crypto trading, even a fraction of the theoretical improvement would already be a huge improvement over value turnover levels of recent years.”\nThe reduced stock transaction tax (from 0.6 percent currently to 0.1 percent) is set to take effect at the start of next month, July 1, 2025, after the Capital Markets Efficiency Promotion Act was signed into law last May 29.\nPSE President and CEO Ramon S. Monzon said the tax is based on the gross selling price or gross value in money of the shares of stock sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed.\n“Section 29 of CMEPA states that the law shall take effect on July 1, 2025, following its complete publication in the Official Gazette or in at least one (1) newspaper of general circulation.\n“On the premise that publication of CMEPA will be completed before July 1, 2025, the STT of one-tenths of one percent (1/10 of 1 percent) shall apply to transactions through the Exchange made on July 1, 2025 onwards,” he said.\nThe bourse said earlier that the reduction is expected to boost trading activity and liquidity in the stock market and PSE's competitiveness against other foreign markets.\nPrior to the enactment of CMEPA, PSE had one of the highest friction costs in the ASEAN region.\nCMEPA also expands the application of STT to other securities listed and traded through a local stock exchange which lends certainty to the tax regime applicable to the secondary transfer through the stock exchange of asset classes other than equities and facilitate the launch of more products in the local stock market.	"\\tImages/stock-transaction-tax-cut-could-supercharge-pse-trading-by-83_1.png"	A stock transaction tax cut could theoretically boost Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) trading by 83%.  A previous tax increase caused an 11% decline in daily turnover.  While the actual impact may be smaller, any increase would be significant, especially given recent market conditions. The reduced tax, from 0.6% to 0.1%, takes effect July 1, 2025.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/16/stock-transaction-tax-cut-could-supercharge-pse-trading-by-83

weaker-philippine-economic-growth-to-bolster-interest-rate-cuts-uob	Weaker Philippine economic growth to bolster interest rate cuts—UOB	Singapore-based United Overseas Bank (UOB) has downgraded its 2025 economic growth forecast for the Philippines amid global trade uncertainties, which, in turn, bolstered its expectations of further interest rate cuts.\nIn its new quarterly global outlook report for the third quarter of 2025, published this month, UOB slashed its Philippine gross domestic product (GDP) growth projection to five percent, from six percent previously.\nUOB’s revised forecast falls below last year’s below-expectations growth rate of 5.7 percent, as well as the government’s more ambitious six- to eight-percent target for this year.\nFollowing the “downbeat” 5.4-percent year-on-year real GDP expansion in the first quarter of 2025—“even before tariffs hit and ongoing global trade threats,” as UOB noted—it expects second-quarter growth to slow to 5.2 percent, the third quarter to 4.9 percent, and the fourth quarter to 4.6 percent.\n“The outlook going into the second half of 2025 hinges largely on external developments such as the outcome of trade deals by major economies including the Philippines with the United States (US) before the 90-day suspension [on US tariffs] ends on July 9, and the Trump administration’s decision on sector-specific tariffs under the Section 232, which involves semiconductor and pharmaceutical products, among others,” UOB said.\n“Thus, domestic demand will come to the rescue, with growth levers including a larger national budget expenditure, easing inflation pressures, broader transmission of monetary policy easing, and sustained overseas cash remittance inflows,” it added.\nFor 2026, UOB forecasts GDP growth at a faster—but still below-goal—5.5 percent.\nGiven its less optimistic near-term economic outlook for the Philippines, UOB sees “plenty of room to cut interest rates” for the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP).\nIn its latest weekly outlook report dated June 13, UOB said its economist Jasrine Loke expects a 25-basis-point (bp) cut in the overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) rate—to 5.25 percent from the current 5.5 percent—at the BSP Monetary Board’s (MB) policy meeting on Thursday, June 19.\nThe anticipated continuation of monetary easing will be “backed by May’s low inflation outturn while higher positive real interest rates, which are at [an] almost 10-year high, also give the central bank plenty of room to ease,” UOB said. Headline inflation fell to a 5.5-year low of 1.3 percent in May.\nIn a May 30 report, UOB economist Lee Sue Ann said that “increasing downside risks to domestic growth prospects and a more benign inflation outlook strengthen the case for the BSP to shift toward a more accommodative monetary policy stance in the near term, amid a relatively strong peso.”\n“We maintain our BSP outlook with three 25-bp cuts this year, one each in June, the third quarter, and the fourth quarter. This will bring the RRP rate to 4.75 percent by end-2025,” Lee said.\nAfter the projected 2025 rate cuts, the BSP is expected to pause monetary loosening at least through the first half of 2026.\nIn its third-quarter outlook report, UOB also lowered its full-year 2025 Philippine inflation forecast to two percent—the lower end of the targeted range of manageable annual price increases deemed conducive to economic growth.\n“Ongoing mitigating factors such as continued non-monetary intervention, softer global energy prices, and a stronger currency, suggest a more moderate inflation outlook than previously anticipated,” UOB said.\nWhile end-May inflation averaged 1.9 percent, UOB said it expects consumer price index (CPI) growth to “rebound back to above two percent in the fourth quarter of 2025.”\nBut it cautioned that “looming tariff uncertainty will also weigh on global demand and pose downside risks to the nation’s near-term inflation prospect.”\nNonetheless, UOB said that “a more benign inflation outlook gives the BSP more flexibility to support the slowing economy going into the second half of 2025 and to fend off a deeper slowdown in growth from tariff uncertainty.”\nUOB noted that the Philippine peso strengthened against the US dollar by 2.8 percent quarter-on-quarter as of early June, “mainly as a result of US tariffs, fiscal outlook, and US credit rating downgrade eroding investors’ confidence on the greenback and dollar-denominated assets.”\nThe peso’s early June trading levels were also 3.6-percent stronger year-to-date.\n“Other factors driving the gains in the Philippine peso included lower global oil prices that would help to narrow the country’s balance of payments (BOP) deficits and to contain inflation; signs of policy continuity as President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. retained his economic managers while replacing his top diplomat during a Cabinet reshuffle on May 22 after an underwhelming performance by his allies in the May 12 midterm elections; and the BSP’s plans to reduce its holdings of US Treasuries and diversify its foreign reserves into other currencies and asset classes,” UOB said, noting that US dollar-denominated assets currently account for four-fifths of reserves.\n“Going forward, sentiment on the Philippine markets is also expected to improve as investors look past the midterm election results and anticipate policy continuity and financial stability. In the near term, the Philippine peso may consolidate recent gains as the expiration of the 90-day tariff pause looms in July,” it added.\nAs such, UOB expects the peso to depreciate to ₱56.5:$1 in the third quarter of 2025, before gradually appreciating to ₱55.8 in the fourth quarter, ₱55.3 in the first quarter of 2026, and ₱55 in the second quarter of next year.

This weaker outlook led UOB to predict further interest rate cuts by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP).

usda-philippine-wheat-imports-to-drop-amid-softening-feed-demand	USDA: Philippine wheat imports to drop amid softening feed demand	The Philippines is expected to import less wheat in the upcoming market year as demand for animal feed weakens, reversing an initial forecast of increased uptake, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).\nIn its “Grain: World Markets and Trade report, the USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) estimated that wheat imports will reach 7.2 million metric tons (MT) within the period starting July 2025 and ending in June 2026.\nThe current projection is three percent lower than last month’s estimate of 7.4 million MT, which was just revised upward from 7.2 million MT on expectations of stronger food and feed demand.\nThe Philippines is not conducive to wheat production and relies solely on imports to meet its wheat supply needs.\nThe country imports milling wheat for human consumption and feed wheat for animal feed.\nThe USDA-FAS in Manila earlier projected that demand for feed wheat will likely soften as local feed manufacturers maintain preference for feed corn due to its physical attributes and fattening qualities.\nFeed wheat, which is used as a multi-purpose feed ingredient, serves as a substitute for feed corn when wheat prices are more favorable than those of feed corn, or in instances where there are supply gaps.\nThe foreign agency observed that imported feed wheat was priced higher than imported corn by $12.22 to $48.41 per MT during the second half of 2024.\nWith the rise in global corn production, prices of feed corn are expected to be more competitive compared to feed wheat in market year 2025-2026.\nWith just one month left in the current market year, USDA is projecting wheat imports to fall to 6.8 million MT from a projection of 7.2 million MT.\nThe anticipated volume is a decline from the 6.9 million MT of wheat the agency estimated to have been imported to the Philippines in the market year 2023-2024.\nDuring market year 2023-2024, the top supplier of wheat to the Philippines was the United States (US), followed by Australia, Brazil, and Canada.\nNext year, the USDA-FAS expects the US to remain as the top supplier of wheat to the country.\nThe Philippines was the US’ second top market for wheat exports in 2024, with a total volume of 2.7 million MT, amounting to $735.71 million.\nMeanwhile, the USDA has retained its projection for the country’s rice imports next year to reach 5.5 million MT.\nThe agency cited the “growth in population, increased tourism, and continued importance as a staple” as the drivers for this record-high figure.\nIf the forecast is realized, the Philippines is set to solidify its ranking as the world’s largest importer of rice for the fourth consecutive year.	"\\tImages/usda-philippine-wheat-imports-to-drop-amid-softening-feed-demand_1.png"	Philippine wheat imports are projected to decrease to 7.2 million metric tons in the 2025-2026 market year due to softening feed demand.  This is a 3% drop from the previous estimate and a decline from the 6.9 million tons imported in 2023-2024.  Local feed manufacturers prefer corn, and corn prices are expected to be more competitive.  The US is expected to remain the top wheat supplier to the Philippines.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/16/usda-philippine-wheat-imports-to-drop-amid-softening-feed-demand
rcbc-to-launch-api-driven-digital-products-by-q3-to-boost-banking-efficiency	RCBC to launch API-driven digital products by Q3 to boost banking efficiency	Filipinos may expect more efficient banking as Yuchengco-led Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. (RCBC), in partnership with Manila-based Hungry Workhorse, is set to roll out application programming interface (API)-supported digital financial products in the bank’s improved digital marketplace in the next three months.\n“This partnership supports RCBC’s recently launched Digital 2.0 Marketplace, which pioneers an API-first approach to banking,” RCBC executive vice president and chief innovations and inclusion officer Angelito M. Villanueva said during the signing ceremony on Monday, June 16.\n“One of the highlights of this contract is the identification of the initial 30 priority APIs that would have to be delivered within 90 days,” or by the third quarter of 2025, Villanueva said.\nAPIs are essential tools that enable modern banking systems to connect and work together, supporting the ongoing shift toward more advanced digital banking platforms. Villanueva said the APIs the bank must deliver will support products related to digital remittances, savings, insurance, and fund transfers.\nVillanueva refused to “put a specific price tag for this engagement,” but he noted that the funding for the initiative is about 10 to 20 percent of the bank>’s budget for digital transformation.\nHe told reporters that RCBC is fast-tracking the rollout as several financial technology (fintech) companies that could be potential partners are eager to collaborate with the bank and want “to execute [the deal] immediately.”\nVillanueva claimed that the new financial services that bank will soon offer will be “much cheaper, much faster, much simpler, and more secure.” He said aside from pricing, the convenience and security that Filipinos would get to experience are among the factors taken into account in the identification of priority APIs.\n“This API-first approach also unlocks exponential impact in scaling inclusive digital finance, fostering co-creation and collaboration with key fintech players, both locally and globally,” Villanueva noted.\nHungry Workhorse, California-based APIwiz’s local implementation arm, ensures “seamless integration and rapid delivery of these next-generation digital banking solutions.” APIwiz offers a centralized management platform for API operations.\nRCBC is the first largest privately owned universal bank in the Philippines, with over ₱1.3 trillion in total resources as of June last year. It is an affiliate of Japan’s second-largest bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp (SMBC).

the-philippines-powers-digital-banking	The Philippines powers digital banking	We don't often hear about tech stories that start right here at home and end up shaping the future beyond our borders. But that's exactly what's happening with the recent partnership between Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC), Philippine-based Hungry Workhorse, and US-based APIwiz. This isn't just another digital initiative. It's a sign of something deeper—how local talent, when paired with the right technology, can drive transformation in a way that's both meaningful and scalable. And maybe, just maybe, exportable.\nRCBC has been pushing the boundaries of digital banking for years, but now they're going all in with an API-first strategy. If that sounds like jargon, it's not. Think of APIs (application programming interfaces) as digital bridges—little connectors that allow apps and systems to talk to each other in real-time. When a bank builds with APIs, it's not just upgrading its website. It's opening up a whole new way for services to be built, shared, and expanded—by both the bank and other players in the ecosystem.\nWhat's exciting is that this isn't just a tech import. While APIwiz provides the platform and global architecture, the actual integration and development work is being led locally by Hungry Workhorse. That means we're not just users of foreign tech—we're builders. And the expertise being developed here can be used not only to transform local banking but also to provide services and talent to other countries heading down the same digital road.\nWe talk a lot about digital transformation in abstract terms, but here it's real. The new RCBC Digital 2.0 Marketplace is designed to offer services in a modular, flexible way. Products can be stitched together like building blocks, giving banks and even third-party providers the ability to create new solutions quickly. It's a model that fits perfectly with the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas' vision of an open, secure digital financial marketplace—one where interoperability, consumer protection, and innovation go hand in hand.\nBut here's the part that really stands out for me: This isn't just about APIs or banking. It's about people. It's about developing Filipino tech talent—not just to fill support roles, but to lead, design, and implement high-value, high-impact systems. Hungry Workhorse isn't just building solutions; it's nurturing local capability, offering hands-on implementation support, design thinking, and strategic development that strengthens the entire ecosystem.\nCultivating homegrown expertise\nThis has huge implications. The Philippines is rich in tech talent, but so much of it is underutilized or exported in bits and pieces. With initiatives like this, we have the chance to cultivate full-stack expertise at home. From ideation to execution, Filipinos are shaping the future of digital finance. And once we perfect this model here, there's no reason we can't offer the same to other emerging markets.\nWe've already seen how digital solutions made by Filipinos—especially in the BPO and software development sectors—have had a global impact. But this partnership shows that we can go beyond outsourced services. We can lead transformation efforts in highly regulated, innovation-heavy spaces like banking. And we can do it in a way that aligns with global standards while keeping our local context front and center.\nI've always believed that technology only matters when it meets human needs. That's what this collaboration is doing. It's making digital banking faster, more secure, and more responsive to real-life Filipino users. But more than that, it's opening a path for Filipino developers, strategists, and designers to be key players in digital finance, both here and eventually abroad.\nThere's a global demand for API-driven solutions. Banks around the world are trying to modernize their systems, open their platforms, and stay compliant with evolving regulations. What RCBC, Hungry Workhorse, and APIwiz are building together isn't just good for the Philippines—it's potentially a model for the rest of the world. And the people behind it? They're homegrown.\nI think we'll look back at this moment and see it as more than just a tech upgrade. It's the beginning of a bigger shift—where Filipino talent isn't just part of the story, but leading it. When we combine vision, infrastructure, and the right kind of partnerships, we unlock a future where our digital capabilities become one of our biggest exports.\nSo yes, it's about APIs. But it's also about ambition. It's about laying down the rails today for the kind of future we want tomorrow. One where the Philippines doesn't just adopt innovation, but creates it—and shares it with the world.\nThe author is the Founder and CEO of Hungry Workhorse, a digital, culture, and customer experience transformation consulting firm.

world-bank-hire-more-women-to-attract-more-foreign-direct-investments-in-developing-countries-like-philippines	World Bank: Hire more women to attract more foreign direct investments in developing countries like Philippines	Aside from strengthening governance to build investors’ confidence in developing countries like the Philippines, the Washington-based World Bank Group (WBG), the world’s largest development bank, said these economies should also increase job opportunities for women as local branches of foreign companies often hire more women.\n“FDI [foreign direct investment] can also help increase job opportunities for women: the domestic affiliates of multinational enterprises, for example, tend to have a higher share of female employees than domestic firms,” the World Bank said in a report published June 17.\nSuch is a recommended policy that developing countries should adopt as FDI inflows to these economies dropped to their trough in almost two decades in 2023, the latest data available to the multilateral lender showed.\n“In 2023, developing economies received just $435 billion in FDI—the lowest level since 2005,” the World Bank reported. FDI flowing into developing countries during the year made up only 2.3 percent of their total economic output, nearly half the level seen during the 2008 peak.\nAs such, the World Bank suggested that governments of developing economies should maximize the positive impact of brick-and-mortar FDI on the economy.\nStrengthening trade ties, improving governance, investing in skills and education, and expanding formal employment help countries gain more from FDI, the report said.\nGovernments can also maximize the benefit of FDI by directing investments into industries that deliver the most economic and social benefits, it added.\nAnother recommendation from the lender was “redoubling efforts to attract” more investments.\n“Easing FDI restrictions that have accumulated over the last decade would be a good start. So would speeding up improvements in the investment climate, which have stalled in many countries over the past decade,” the World Bank said.\nLastly, the World Bank urged improving cooperation with other countries, as doing so will encourage collaboration to speed up policy efforts that will help steer FDI toward developing nations that need it the most.\nTo recall, net inflows of brick-and-mortar FDI into the Philippines fell to $498 million in March, the lowest in three months. This was attributed to the heightened political instability and lingering United States (US) tariff-led uncertainty eroded investor confidence.\nThe latest data from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) showed that March FDI declined by 27.8 percent from $689 million a year earlier. It was the lowest since December last year, when they reached only $110 million.\nFDI net inflows for the first three months also declined by 41.1 percent to $1.8 billion from the $3 billion recorded in the same period a year ago.

In 2023, FDI inflows to developing economies hit a two-decade low of $435 billion.  Increasing job opportunities for women is suggested, as multinational enterprises tend to employ more women than domestic firms.  The World Bank also suggests improving governance and easing FDI restrictions to boost investment.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/17/world-bank-hire-more-women-to-attract-more-foreign-direct-investments-in-developing-countries-like-philippines

We recognize the need for us to diversify our portfolio and boldly tap into the opportunities in the ultra-luxury residential market,” said Megaworld Executive Director Kevin L. Tan.\nHe added that, “These developments are so rare that Megaworld plans to offer these only in select locations, just once or twice every year.”\nGutierrez added that, “This will be a rare collection of residential properties that are distinctly opulent, different from the usual Megaworld residential projects.\n“Because these are rare, one of its kind, be it in terms of location, design, features, innovations, amenities, or even in terms of collaboration and partnership to create the product.”\nThe launch comes amid growing demand for exclusive, long-hold real estate among Ultra High Net Worth Individuals (UHNWIs) in the Philippines and overseas.\nAs personal and generational wealth expands, so too does the appetite for quiet luxury, discreet ownership, and non-fungible real estate assets.\nAccording to US-based global financial analytics firm S&P Global, the ultra-luxury real estate market in the Philippines is currently experiencing increased growth and huge demand, driven largely by buyers’ resilience against inflation and high-interest rates.\nMegaworld said its entry into this space builds on its over 30 years of experience in high-value residential development—now refined for the most discerning clientele.\nThe Megaworld SIGNATURE COLLECTION signals a deliberate pivot toward architectural singularity, long-term capital preservation, and heirloom-quality design.\n“We chose the name because each residence bears the mark of purposeful design. Every development is envisioned as a one-of-a-kind property and offered with discretion—chosen by those who truly understand the value of rarity.\nWe are creating an entirely brand new group to handle our Megaworld SIGNATURE COLLECTION. We will be launching our inaugural project for this category within the year,” said Gutierrez-Alfonso.

upskilling-top-philippine-business-executives-part-3	Upskilling top Philippine business executives, part 3	Formal tertiary education is facing a crisis due to its historical inability to equip graduates with the knowledge and skills actually demanded by the business and industry world. In response, some highly innovative entrepreneurs in the education sector are introducing new approaches to professional education. These approaches are attracting a large number of students whose main concern is no longer just a college diploma, but employability. Examples of these educational institutions, growing their enrollment by leaps and bounds, include the PHINMA schools (already enrolling over 180,000 students across the Archipelago), the National University (NU) system spearheaded by Hans Sy, and the Far Eastern University (FEU) system chaired by top banker Gigi Montinola.\nThe University of Asia and the Pacific (UA&P) isn't in the same league as these mammoth universities. However, it's just as keenly interested in leveraging its reputation as a leading business school to address the current demand from businesses for very specific knowledge and skills. UA&P constantly hones its relatively small enrollment in the knowledge and skills needed to meet the demands of an economy already facing the so-called Industrial Revolution 4.0 (Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Robotics, Data Analytics, etc.). This is done without ignoring the fact that the Philippine economy still has much to do to address the first three industrial revolutions: IR 1.0, the mechanical revolution that began in England from 1790 to 1830; IR 2.0, the electric revolution in the 19th century with the invention of electricity; and IR 3.0, the electronics (chips) revolution of the twentieth century.\nEven more serious is the problem that the Philippines hasn't gone through the required green or agricultural revolution that must precede the industrial revolution for large, resource-rich countries like ours. In fact, the agricultural sector is the Achilles' heel of the Philippine economy, representing some 70 percent of the nearly 20 million people who fall below the poverty line (about 16 percent of the total population). That's why, since its very inception, CRC has prioritized dedicating some of its faculty and research resources—more than offering academic degrees related to agribusiness—to guiding and providing vital information to professionals in both the private and government sectors on how to develop the agricultural and fisheries sector through the Center for Food and Agribusiness (CFA). The CFA was founded and led for almost forty years by the late Dr. Rolando Dy, one of the best agribusiness economists in the country. He was a perfect example of reskilling. He graduated with a Bachelor of Metallurgical Engineering but, through work experience and a degree in industrial economics, became the nation's foremost expert in agribusiness. Since its inception, the CFA has been upskilling, reskilling, and retooling Philippine managers working in the agribusiness sector. Today, UA&P devotes much of its faculty and research resources to offering an executive education program for agribusiness entrepreneurs and managers through its Agribusiness Executive Program (AEP). This is really just a variation of the Strategic Business Economics Program (SBEP), our longest-running program at UA&P, which has upskilled over 1,000 top executives (including some foreign managers) in business and industry economics.\nBy 2022, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, UA&P came full circle. It expanded the original upskilling and reskilling program of the initial CRC in 1969, when it offered the Industrial Economics Program (IEP) at its original site in Jorge Bocobo St. in Malate, Manila. It launched Continuing Real World Education (CORE) as a platform that provides curated, relevant, and responsive programs to address the needs of organizations, especially in business, for upskilling, reskilling, and retooling their human resources. CORE is a response to the rapid changes in the business landscape, especially what we refer to as Industrial Revolution 4.0. It partners closely with business enterprises to help them keep up with the evolving demands of executive education. CORE's mission is to help top executives transform themselves and the rest of their human capital into relevant, morally responsible, and valuable assets of their respective organizations and institutions.\nTo cater to the specific needs of each sector and institution, CORE's initial offerings (delivered by UA&P's full-time faculty in cooperation with outside experts in different disciplines and specializations) include:\n* Customized executive and management development programs\n* General management courses related to effective communication and leadership, media management, and project and middle management training\n* Benchmarked and relevant governance programs and certifications, data governance and data protection officer courses, and applied sustainability management\n* Succession programs promoting unity in the family and the family business\n* Certificate programs on strategic business economics and agribusiness\n* Church management seminar\n* Graduate management courses\nIn addition to these upskilling and reskilling programs open to the public, CORE offers in-house programs to individual enterprises such as East West Bank, MORE Power, TELUS, and Fast Logistics. Industry associations also contract CORE to provide specialized training programs to their member companies, updating managers on recent technological trends. For instance, CORE launched the Diploma Program in Supply Chain Management (DPSCM) with the Philippine Institute of Supply Management and the Foundation of the Society of Fellows in Supply Management. DPSCM aims to thoroughly enhance a participant's competency as a manager by teaching them the facets of supply management. Its end-to-end coverage—from Demand and Replenishment, Procurement, Customer Service to Distribution, including management skills—renders the program holistic.\nUA&P intends to further utilize its teaching and research forces to design management courses for individual companies, following the outstanding example of its partner European business school, the IESE Business School in Barcelona, Spain. As regularly reported by the Financial Times, The Economist, and other international publications, IESE consistently ranks in the top ten for the quality of various management development programs like the MBA, Advanced Management Program, and Executive MBA. However, it is always Number One in customized, in-house management development programs. It's our vision at UA&P to be the best, not only in the Philippines but at least in the Southeast Asian region, in delivering in-house, customized upskilling and reskilling programs for large and medium-sized businesses. To be continued.	"\\tImages/upskilling-top-philippine-business-executives-part-3_1.png"	Philippine tertiary education faces a crisis in equipping graduates with industry-relevant skills, prompting innovative educational institutions like PHINMA, NU, and FEU to focus on employability.  UA&P, while smaller, addresses this by offering specialized programs aligning with Industrial Revolution 4.0 demands, also acknowledging the need to address earlier industrial revolutions and the agricultural sector's challenges.  The university's CORE program provides customized upskilling and reskilling for businesses, including in-house training and collaborations with industry associations.  UA&P aims to become a leading provider of customized upskilling and reskilling programs in Southeast Asia.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/17/upskilling-top-philippine-business-executives-part-3

staggered-fuel-price-increases-loom-as-oil-supply-fears-mount	Staggered fuel price increases loom as oil supply fears mount	The market is on edge due to the recent geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel, prompting the Philippines to brace for potential price increases at gas pumps next week.\nJetti Petroleum has indicated that the escalating conflict could impact the supply and transportation of crude oil products.\nThe growing uncertainty around the Iran-Israel hostilities and concerns that the conflict may intensify and disrupt supply, particularly in the Strait of Hormuz, has further pushed up the prices of crude oil and refined fuel products, stated Leo Bellas, Jetti president.\nAs the country anticipates these price adjustments, Jetti Petroleum has affirmed its support for the Department of Energy’s (DOE) call for a possible staggered implementation of next week's price increase. Bellas confirmed, “For the possible staggered implementation of next week’s price increase, we will abide by any directive from the DOE.”\nBased on the Mean of Platts Singapore (MOPS) average from June 16 to 17, diesel prices could rise by as much as ₱3.40 to ₱3.60 per liter, while gasoline could spike between ₱2.30 to ₱2.50 per liter. However, these figures are not yet the final adjustments for next week.\nDiversified Energy Sources Sought\nWhile analysts continue to assess the effects of the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict, Michael Ricafort, chief economist of Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. (RCBC), has outlined strategies the country might consider to mitigate the impact of escalating oil prices.\nIf there is an escalation of the Israel-Iran war, that could further lead to higher global oil prices and inflation, Ricafort told Manila Bulletin. He also cited other contributing factors to rising inflation, such as the weakening of the Peso to ₱56.90 per dollar and global crude oil prices hitting $75 per barrel.\nMotorists are not the only consumers affected; Ricafort noted that a slight pick-up in inflation could lead to an increase in the country’s trade deficit, import prices, and overall trade. Some pick-up in prices, especially oil/energy, could reduce disposable income or spending power of consumers, as consumer spending accounts for about 75 percent of the economy, Ricafort explained.\nPotential solutions, according to the economist, include hedging oil and imports, diversifying oil sources, and supporting the growth of cleaner energy sources such as electric vehicles (EVs). He elaborated, “There is a need to properly hedge the country’s oil and other import requirements amid risk of volatile world oil and other commodity prices that could lead to higher prices/inflation, as well as further diversify sources of oil/energy, on top of conservation measures and further shift to renewable energy to help structurally reduce dependence of the country on imported oil/petroleum.”\nRicafort also emphasized the need to boost renewable energy (RE) integration, highlighting the DOE's recent efforts to expand its EV charging network to nearly 1,000 stations nationwide. He concluded, “Now with increased shift to REs such as wind/offshore wind, solar, geothermal, and hydro… Many companies/businesses and governments commit to reduce carbon emissions/footprint in the coming years.”	"\\tImages/staggered-fuel-price-increases-loom-as-oil-supply-fears-mount_1.png"	Geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel threaten fuel supply, leading to anticipated price increases in the Philippines.

sec-vows-to-strengthen-anti-money-laundering-measures-after-phs-exit-from-european-commissions-high-risk-list	SEC vows to strengthen anti-money laundering measures after PH's exit from European Commission's high-risk list	The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has vowed to further strengthen its efforts to combat money laundering and terrorism financing in the corporate sector following the Philippines’ exit from the European Commission’s (EC) list of high-risk jurisdictions for financial crimes.\n“The SEC welcomes the Philippines’ exit from the EC list of high-risk jurisdictions. This milestone emphasizes the country’s strong commitment to ensuring the integrity of the financial and corporate sectors, making the country a more attractive hub for investors,” SEC Chairperson Francis Ed. Lim said.\nHe added that, “As the overseer of the corporate sector and the capital market, the SEC will continue adopting best practices in AML/CFT [anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism] regulation, in line with global standards, to ensure that the corporate vehicle will not be used for illicit funding.”\nThe EC, the executive body of the European Union (EU), on June 10 issued a statement announcing the removal of the Philippines from the high-risk list, along with seven other jurisdictions.\nThe country’s delisting jumps off from the same reforms the Philippines implemented to strengthen its AML/CFT framework, driving its exit from the grey list of global watchdog Financial Action Task Force (FATF).\nIn February, FATF officially announced the Philippines’ exit from the list of jurisdictions under increased monitoring since its inclusion in June 2021, citing reforms that addressed strategic deficiencies in its AML/CFT framework.\nAs part of the Marcos administration’s whole-of-government approach, the SEC has been instrumental in driving reforms that drove the grey list exit. These reforms responded to concerns on beneficial ownership information disclosure and registration of non-profit organizations (NPOs).\nThe SEC, as early as 2019, has strengthened the disclosure of beneficial ownership data, requiring companies to declare such information in their general information sheets (GIS).\nLikewise, it prevented the issuance and sale of bearer shares and bearer share warrants in 2021 to boost transparency and prevent the use of corporations for illegal activities.\nEarly this month, the Commission launched the hierarchical and applicable relations and beneficial ownership registry (HARBOR), an online platform that caters to the submission and updating of beneficial ownership information.\nThis will enable the SEC to provide faster and more reliable beneficial ownership data to businesses, regulators and government agencies.\nTo improve transparency among NPOs, the SEC has conducted outreach and knowledge-sharing activities to encourage them to register with the Commission to minimize the risk of being used for illicit financing activities.\nThese efforts resulted in the registration of nearly 8,000 NPOs since 2021.\nThe SEC is also strengthening the enforcement of AML/CFT policies over financial institutions under its jurisdiction, including brokers, dealers, lending and financing corporations, and other securities dealers.\nRecently, the SEC issued Memorandum Circular Nos. 4 and 5, Series of 2025, providing for the SEC rules on crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) and SEC guidelines on the operations of CASPs, respectively. The rules seek to ensure investor protection while supporting innovative financial products.\n“Necessary systems and measures are already in place. The SEC will remain proactive in ensuring that these are strictly implemented and complied with, to prevent the country’s relisting and to foster a sound business environment where companies can thrive,” Lim said.

The SEC will continue strengthening AML/CFT regulations to prevent illicit funding.  Reforms included beneficial ownership disclosure and NPO registration, leading to the grey list exit.  The SEC is proactively implementing measures to maintain this progress and foster a sound business environment.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/17/sec-vows-to-strengthen-anti-money-laundering-measures-after-phs-exit-from-european-commissions-high-risk-list

The other rum brand was India’s 1965.\nThe Millionaires' Club based its rankings on public company reports and requesting data directly from the world’s biggest spirits brand owners.\n“Some of the growth percentages do not correspond to the year-on-year volume sales comparative, this is because we calculate growth from the actual volume data supplied, which could be two to three decimal places, but we round this data to one decimal place for easy reading,” the publication said.\nIt added that, “Where brands appear equal on volume sales, ranking is determined by the highest decimal point, which is not displayed and blank spaces indicate that data was not available or the brand didn’t exist in that year.”\nFounded in 1854, Tanduay has built a legacy of excellence in the spirits industry throughout the years.\nIts growth continues across a diverse range of international markets outside of the Philippines, including Armenia, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Georgia, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Malta, New Zealand, People’s Republic of China, Peru, Poland, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, the Netherlands, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US).

The appraised value and the exchange price are within the values indicated in the fairness opinion issued by FTI.\nThe Transaction has been approved by the Board of Directors of RL Fund Management Inc., the Fund Manager of RCR, and the Related Party Transactions Committee of RCR.\nIt is subject to the approval of the stockholders of RCR, in a special meeting duly called for the purpose to be held on August 13, 2025, as well as by pertinent regulatory bodies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, the PSE, the Bureau of Internal Revenue, and the Philippine Competition Commission.\nWith the additional shares to be issued to RLC, the public ownership of RCR will be 34.22 percent of the total shares of RCR once the Transaction has closed.\nThis is still above the mandated public ownership of at least one-third of the total outstanding capital stock applicable to Real Estate Investment Trusts under the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) Act of 2009.\nRevenues shall accrue to RCR starting on the first day of the month of execution of the Deed of Assignment, subject to the approval of the stockholders and pertinent regulatory bodies, resulting to higher distributable income for its shareholders.\nThe Properties are expected to contribute further to RCR’s cashflows, increasing its dividends per share.

vivant-energy-eyes-46-billion-investments-through-2030	Vivant Energy eyes ₱46-billion investments through 2030	Vivant Corp. is eyeing approximately ₱46 billion in cumulative investments within the next five years to expand its renewable platforms. Meanwhile, around ₱10 billion in water infrastructure investments are expected through 2030. In a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) on Friday, June 20, Vivant Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Arlo G. Sarmiento explained that the company is focused on growing its energy and water projects in Visayas, stating that, “As we move toward 2030, our efforts in energy and water remain aligned with the country’s long-term needs.” Vivant stated that it is aiming to support the government’s renewable energy (RE) goals by increasing its own RE capacity to 30 percent by 2030. As of year-end 2024, Vivant’s attributable generation capacity stood at 451 megawatts (MW), through a diversified mix of coal and diesel assets on its on-grid and off-grid sites. “Our strong performance was the result of deliberate choices, clear priorities, and disciplined execution,” Sarmiento said. Last year, its Delta P. Inc. secured a 15-year long-term power supply deal with Palawan Electric Cooperative (Paleco) to enhance power supply in mainland Palawan by 40 megawatts (MW). Other power supply deals include missionary electrification efforts in Busuanga and Coron, as executed by the Calamian Islands Power Corp. Other developments include the 206-MW wind project in Northern Samar, which is slated for completion by 2027. In Luzon, Vivant announced that its solar power facility in Bulacan is set to commercially operate by 2025. Moreover, its Isla Mactan-Cordova Corp.’s desalination facility is preparing ahead of commercial operations, which is scheduled within the second half of the year. This is a 25-year joint venture agreement with Metropolitan Cebu Water District. Its wastewater treatment facility in Puerto Princesa has also begun operations, which has said to benefit residents in the island.

upper-wawa-dam-completion-fast-tracked-december-operations-slated	Upper Wawa Dam completion fast-tracked, December operations slated	WawaJVCo, Inc. said the company is accelerating preparations for the Upper Wawa Dam's commercial operations in December, following the project's completion seven months ahead of schedule.\nIn a statement on Friday, June 20, the joint venture company between Prime Infrastructure Capital, Inc. and San Lorenzo Ruiz Builders and Developers Group announced that it had completed the dam’s construction.\nThe company noted that the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contractor recently handed over the project to WawaJVCo.\n“The completion of the Upper Wawa Dam reflects Prime Infra and WawaJVCo’s ability to deliver large-scale infrastructure projects on time. This marks the beginning of one of our most critical water projects,” Melvin John Tan, Prime Infra market sector lead for water and WawaJVCo President, said.\nThe ₱26 billion project has undergone various evaluations, such as the testing of the Upper Wawa Dam’s gates, the functionality of the environmental flow turbine, and other sensors and instruments within the facility.\nOnce it becomes operational, the dam is expected to supply up to 710 million liters of water daily throughout the year, marking it as the largest water supply dam constructed in the last 50 years.\nWithin the service area of the Metropolitan Waterworks & Sewerage System (MWSS), the facility is anticipated to provide service to 3.5 million consumers or around 700,000 households.\nConstruction works began last 2021, featuring a 450-hectare reservoir that is said to be double the size of Bonifacio Global City (BGC) in Taguig.\nThe Upper Wawa Dam is expected to store up to 120 million cubic meters of water.

united-kingdom-seeks-stronger-trade-ties-with-philippines	United Kingdom seeks stronger trade ties with Philippines	The United Kingdom (UK) is reaffirming its strong commitment to free trade by expanding bilateral trade with the Philippines through a more robust trade preference scheme in the export market and other growth-driving sectors.\nLast year, total trade in goods and services between the UK and the Philippines reached £3 billion, or approximately ₱219 billion, a three-percent increase from £2.9 billion in 2023.\nUK Trade Envoy George Freeman said there is a strong potential that the value of the trade relationship could double within the next three to four years through strategic partnerships.\nFreeman said 99 percent of the Philippines’ exports to the UK is tariff-free courtesy of the European nation’s Developing Countries Trading Scheme (DCTS), which cuts tariffs and simplifies trade rules to boost trade.\n“That is a commitment to free trade. And I would gently make the point that not all countries are so committed at the moment to tariff-free trade. We are, and it's something we deeply share, because Filipinos benefit from that,” Freeman said in a media roundtable on Friday, June 20.\nBritish Embassy Manila Director of Trade and Investment Lindsey Gilbert-Crouch said the Philippines is “one of the biggest utilizers” of DCTS. While she did not disclose the utilization rate, she noted that it is “increasing year-on-year.”\nShe said the goal is to reach 100-percent utilization to further drive greater exchange of goods and services.\nGilbert-Crouch said the UK is particularly looking for more exports of food products such as coconuts and mangoes, as well as artisanal products, such as leather goods.\nFreeman added that he will be pushing for the greater use of the £5-billion UK Export Finance Guarantee, which is seen to be underutilized, to help finance UK firms looking to expand their presence in the Philippines.\nHe told reporters that he is keen to allocate more of this fund, as part of Britain’s commitment in its bilateral trade with the Philippines.\nBased on data from the UK Embassy, total exports of the Philippines to the UK reached £1.8 billion last year.\nOn the contrary, Britain’s export to the Philippines stood at £1.2 billion.\nAs part of the finance guarantee, Freeman said an extra allocation has been made for the sectors of defense and security.\nAlongside these programs, the British government has established SheTrades, which helps boost the exports of women entrepreneurs to the UK through DCTS.\nThe UK government earlier launched a new exporters’ handbook to encourage a higher utilization of the scheme.\nGiven the volatility in the global trade environment, Freeman said deepening trade ties with the Philippines is critical to maintain a stable relationship between two major trading partners.\n“Well, I think one has to accept that we live in a dangerous world, right? The Middle East is in flames. There's a war in Europe. It's difficult to legislate for unpredictable geopolitics. You know, who would have predicted that America would put tariffs on trade with their allies?” he explained.\n“So we can only take account of what we can be responsible for,” he added.\nFreeman noted that it’s “too early to tell” the impact of the tariff policy of the United States (US) since the imposition of new taxes varies on each country.\nWhat he was clear about, however, is the UK remains committed to fostering free trade as it believes that this is fundamental to freedom and free speech.	"\\tImages/united-kingdom-seeks-stronger-trade-ties-with-philippines_1.png"	UK aims to significantly boost trade with the Philippines, with potential to double its value in three to four years.  Ninety-nine percent of Philippine exports to the UK are already tariff-free under the DCTS.  The UK seeks increased exports of Philippine food and artisanal products, and will utilize a £5 billion export finance guarantee.  Deepening trade ties is crucial given global market volatility.	https://mb.com.ph/2025/06/20/united-kingdom-seeks-stronger-trade-ties-with-philippines
